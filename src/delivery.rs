//! §11 delivery / worktree plugin — the DIRECT (local-squash) variant.
//!
//! A SIBLING of the tracker, default-wired but separate, so worktrees-without-
//! remote ⊥ remote-without-worktrees. It owns the deliverable CODE worktree —
//! a `git worktree` of the PROJECT repo on `work/<id>` — end to end. Base balls
//! never opens the project repo; "nothing on main / nothing in the project
//! tree" is therefore structural.
//!
//! **Kind-blind & stateless across ops.** The plugin NEVER branches on task
//! kind. The worktree path and branch are pure functions of `(binding, id)`
//! ([`worktree_path`] / `work/<id>`); `<id>` rides the post wire (the immutable
//! `bl-id` trailer) or — on a pre hook, where the id is not sealed yet (§7) —
//! is read back from the single changed `tasks/<id>.md` in the change worktree
//! ([`resolve_id`]). Every hook recomputes its resource and checks the
//! filesystem, so every hook is idempotent by construction.
//!
//! **Per-session re-materialization (§11/§12).** `prime.post` carries no single
//! ball (it is a diffless checkout-lifecycle op, §13), so it does not derive one
//! `<id>`: instead it scans the anvil checkout for every task still claimed
//! by the actor ([`crate::delivery_repo::claimed_ids`]) and re-materializes each
//! one's worktree — the SAME `materialize` act `claim.post` performs, just
//! driven per-claimed-task. Create-if-absent makes it idempotent, so a prime on
//! a session whose worktrees already exist converges to a no-op.
//!
//! This module is the policy: [`dispatch`] maps `(op, phase, rolling_back)` to
//! the [`Repo`] act it performs (§11 hooks + §14 rollback). The git itself is
//! the [`Repo`] seam — [`crate::delivery_repo::Project`] is the real impl;
//! `dispatch` is unit-tested against a fake, so the branch matrix is covered
//! without a temp repo per case.
