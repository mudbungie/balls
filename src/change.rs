//! §9 deliverable-verb base changes — one [`BaseChange`] per verb.
//!
//! Each verb authors a `tasks/<id>.md` diff at [`BaseChange::stage`], then
//! renders its §5 message at [`BaseChange::finalize`] by RE-READING the
//! post-`pre` tree (so a `create/pre` reassigned id, or a `pre` retitle, is
//! reflected). The impls are git-free — they read/write the worktree dir
//! directly, leaving the [`crate::lifecycle::Engine`]'s anvil the only git in
//! an op — and the clock and minted id are injected, so authoring is pure and
//! unit-testable on a plain temp dir.
//!
//! `claim`/`unclaim`/`close` are NAMED specializations of `update` (§9):
//! [`Occupancy`] fixes `claimant` (claim carries two guards — the already-claimed
//! refusal here, plus the §10 claim-blocker guard via [`crate::enforce`]),
//! [`Retire`] stages the file DELETION, [`Update`] applies a generic
//! [`FieldEdit`] list. Each mutating op runs the SAME op-keyed guard
//! ([`crate::enforce::gate`], §10/§15) for its own verb — `claim`/`close` via
//! their named [`crate::enforce::claim`]/[`crate::enforce::close`] spellings, the
//! rest (`unclaim`/`update`) directly — so a blocker on ANY op is honored.
//! They stay distinct ops because the op NAME is the §6 hook-dispatch key.
//!
//! The §10 guards run at [`BaseChange::stage`] — before the seal, so a refusal
//! aborts the op cleanly, and for `close` before any `close.pre` plugin (e.g.
//! delivery) squashes. The enforcement itself lives in [`crate::enforce`].
