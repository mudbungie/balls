//! §12/§13 checkout-lifecycle ops — `bl prime` and `bl sync`, wired to the
//! engine. These author no ball-file diff, so they run the DIFFLESS shape (§8
//! "skip steps 1/3/5"): no change worktree, no seal — the configured plugin
//! chain runs against the STORE checkout directly ([`crate::lifecycle::Engine`]).
//!
//! - **`prime`** is the idempotent orchestrator of syncs (§12/§13): found the
//!   `balls/config` LANDING on a miss ([`crate::substrate`]), then run ONE
//!   core-owned pass ([`prime_chain`]) — `prime/pre` (the tracker clones an
//!   established remote store in), [`crate::substrate::materialize`] for the
//!   configured `tasks_branch` (laid down LAZILY, no eager orphan to diverge,
//!   bl-0a23; a `pre` that MOVED the name aborts, bl-698d), `prime/post` (the
//!   tracker's fetch-ff + push) — THEN drives `sync` against the store so an
//!   established checkout is brought current. Currency comes from invoking the
//!   sync primitive, never a reimplemented fetch (the single-codepath
//!   invariant). Re-running converges.
//! - **`sync`** is the synchronization primitive (§13): run the `sync` chain
//!   against the store (the tracker's `sync/pre` does the fetch + ff-only). With
//!   no arg it syncs the config `tasks_branch`; `bl sync <branch>` PULLS that
//!   named branch (the positional substitutes `tasks_branch` in the binding).
//!   Syncing the landing is a no-op FOR FREE: the landing is upstream-less by
//!   construction (§4), and the tracker's general rule — fetch the branch's
//!   upstream, if any — yields nothing for it. Core special-cases no name (§13).
//!
//! Core stays local-only (§0): it ensures the two LOCAL checkouts and reads
//! config from the landing; the one component that talks to a remote is the
//! `tracker` plugin the chain runs. The §7 binding it builds is the ONE
//! construction point ([`binding`]) shared with [`crate::mutate`].

/// (§12/§13). Bootstrap-on-miss founds the LANDING; the [`prime_chain`] pass
/// materializes the store and runs the `prime` chain; THEN prime drives `sync` so
/// an established checkout is brought current. Prime's binding already names the
/// config `tasks_branch` with the resolved remote — exactly what a no-arg `sync`
/// binds — so the SAME binding serves both: prime calls the `sync` primitive,
/// never a reimplemented fetch. Idempotent: a just-founded remote's sync fetch is
/// a no-op; in stealth the tracker `sync/pre` no-ops.
///
/// `--install CENTER` fuses prime + install + prime on demand (§13): after the
/// substrate exists, [`adopt`] copies the center's committed `config/` into the
/// landing (the consent-gated §6 install — the `--install` flag IS the consent),
/// THEN this same call's prime+sync chains bring the just-adopted `tasks_branch`
/// to readiness. It is a SINGLE hop, not a walk: a center's config names its own
/// `tasks_branch` (the one config→store indirection, §4), never another config to
/// chase. The center also seeds the store remote (the explicit remote used for
/// the binding) unless an explicit `--remote` overrides it. Plain prime (no
/// `--install`) never adopts foreign config nor activates code — the auto-safe
/// every-session path holds.
///
/// `--stealth` is the §12 consent opt-out, and it is DURABLE: sugar for
/// `bl conf set task-remote none` — one committed landing-config write of the
/// stealth sentinel (an explicit flag you typed is the §4 "by you" path), which
/// every later op's [`bind`] derives its stealth from. Consent withheld binds
/// the CHECKOUT, not one prime invocation (bl-9df0). It contradicts
/// `--remote`/`--center`/`--install` (each names a remote), refused at parse.
