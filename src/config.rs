//! §4 config VALUES — the `EffectiveConfig`, read from the LANDING.
//!
//! Config's durable home is the landing (`balls/config`); it is NEVER read from
//! the store and NEVER layered down a trail (there is no trail — §12). The
//! EFFECTIVE config is the landing's `config/balls.toml` overlaid by the
//! per-machine XDG user file, with built-in serde defaults beneath. A center's
//! config reaches you only by `install` copying it INTO the landing (§6), where
//! it becomes local — so this read is the sole authority for what runs.
//!
//! [`EffectiveConfig::resolve`] is PURE over LOCAL checkouts: the caller hands in
//! the landing checkout and the XDG user-config path; this reads each
//! `config/balls.toml` and folds them per §4. It never fetches.
//!
//! §4 layers, INNERMOST wins (highest priority first):
//!   1. CLI flags                                   — a documented seam (below)
//!   2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/balls/config.toml`        — `user_config`
//!   3. `config/balls.toml` on the landing
//!   4. built-in defaults                           — serde fills any absent field
//!
//! Merge semantics (§4): scalar/object fields — innermost layer fully replaces
//! outer (objects are NOT deep-merged). List fields — bare `<field>` = full
//! replacement; compose with `<field>_prepend` / `<field>_append` / `<field>_ban`.
//!
//! The §4 layer-1 CLI override is an unbuilt seam: no flag consumes `tasks_branch`
//! today, so wiring an argv layer here would be a consumer-less mechanism. When
//! a flag needs it, it composes as one more (highest) table.
