Consolidated spec: the single current source of truth (§0–§16). Assembled 2026-06-02 from the prior
body and 13 working notes, then completed as each topic ball under epic bl-b465 settled and edited
its § here directly. **Every design topic is now resolved and folded (§15); this is the finished
design, the basis for the implementation epic.** Implementation diverges from current balls — the
spec describes the greenfield target, not what ships today.

**REVISED 2026-06-05 (post-finalization, supersedes parts of bl-62bc/bl-0601).** Config-shadowing and
the trail/terminus/`operating` model are RETIRED. Config and tasks now ride SEPARATE branches —
`balls/config` (the landing) + `balls/tasks` (the store) — with `config/` and `tasks/` as top-level
folders always (reuse-safe, §2). Config NAMES the store via `tasks_branch` (§4); there is no trail,
no terminus, no `operating/` symlink, no config layering down a chain. **Landing config is the sole
authority** for what runs + where it syncs; ALL config is potential RCE and crosses only by `install`,
a **pure path-copy** (folder = mirror, file/glob = union — §6); a fresh landing is SEEDED at prime from
the app `default-config/` folder (no run-time defaults — §1); `sync` moves only the store. Touched
§0/§1/§2/§4/§6/§7/§8/§12/§13/§16. Corrections to already-built phases are tracked under bl-72a8.

## §0 Overview & core principles

balls is a git-native task tracker. State lives on TWO branches of a git repo — `balls/config` (the
**landing**: this checkout's config, path-derived, always local) and `balls/tasks` (the **store**:
the `tasks/<id>.md` data). Config NAMES the store (`tasks_branch`, §4); the store holds only data.
Both are default-named but reuse-safe (§2). Persistence is git, local-first. Base balls is the
smallest possible thing — it commits config edits to the landing and task-file edits to the store.
Everything that touches the world beyond those branches is a **plugin**. The shipped `tracker`
plugin is the only thing that talks to a remote (it syncs the store branch); the shipped
delivery/worktree plugin is the only thing that touches the project's code. Strip every plugin and
balls is a pure local task list.

Load-bearing principles (each enforced structurally, not by discipline):

- **Two branches, never `main`.** State lives only on the landing (config) and the store (tasks) —
  never on `main` or any project branch. "Nothing on main" is STRUCTURAL: base balls never opens
  the project repo, so core *cannot* leave a commit there. Config and tasks ride SEPARATE branches
  because they have OPPOSITE transport disciplines (§2/§6): config is single-owner, install-replaced
  (destructive, no merge); the store is shared, sync-merged (union, ff-only). One ref cannot carry
  both disciplines, so the split is what makes each safe — enforced structurally, not by discipline.
- **Unopinionated about workflow; no status field.** There is no `state`/`status` field at
  all (§3, bl-4778): status is a DERIVED view, not stored — `claimant` set ⇒ claimed, an unresolved
  claim-blocker ⇒ blocked (§10), a deleted file ⇒ closed/dropped (§9). Core enforces only the MEANING of its primitives, never a particular
sequence: `claim` refuses an already-claimed ball or an open claim-blocker (`!ready()`), `close` an
open close-blocker (`!closeable()`, §10), all reading structured fields. balls ships workflow
PRIMITIVES (occupancy + blockers), not a workflow; users, agents, and plugins compose them into
whatever process they want — "review before close," sign-offs, build gates are emergent (a gate
child plus a tag), never core rules. Destination semantics, not source.
- **Plugins are a sequence of binaries.** Invoked blocking, in the order the hook list gives, per
  op-phase. Non-zero exit aborts the op and rolls prior plugins back in reverse. That is the whole protocol.
- **Core knows two things about a plugin:** its name and its binary path. It never reads a plugin's
  config. Plugins coordinate only through core schema (task fields), never by sniffing each other.
- **LOCAL config is the sole authority — never a remote.** Core decides what runs and where it syncs
  from local config only: the landing's `config/balls.toml` (`tasks_branch`) + `config/plugins.toml`
  (the hook list, §4), with the per-machine XDG layer and CLI flags as local-trusted overrides (§4 read order). The
  landing is the durable, committed home of that authority; XDG and flags are your own machine, not a
  remote input. It changes only by user command (`install`, §6, or a direct landing/XDG edit) — never
  by automatic discovery. **All config is treated as potential RCE** and crosses into a landing only by
  the explicit copy `install` performs; reading or syncing a remote is free but NEVER authoritative. There are **no run-time defaults**: a fresh landing
  is SEEDED at prime by copying the app-level `default-config/` folder (§1/§12), so the trusted set
  (tracker, delivery, builtin plugins) are ordinary entries in the landing's list — not a magic
  carve-out. Swap that folder and you swap the default capability set: policy lives in config, not core.
- **Subtract before adding.** A new verb/state/field/flag is a smell; prefer an existing signal.
  Derive values rather than store them; make a component indifferent rather than teach it cases.

**Vocabulary** (see §2/§12): the **landing** is the always-present, path-derived local `balls/config`
branch holding this checkout's config — including `tasks_branch`, the one pointer that says where the
store is. The **store** is the `tasks/` on `tasks_branch` (default `balls/tasks`); config NAMES it,
the store holds only data. There is NO trail, terminus, or `operating/` indirection: config is read
from the landing, tasks are read/written on `tasks_branch`, and federation is many landings naming
ONE shared store branch (§12). "Stealth" is not a mode — it is simply a `tasks_branch` with no
configured remote (the store is local-only).

## §1 XDG layout

```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/balls/
  config.toml                          # user-level config layer (§4)
  default-config/                      # the SEED: prime copies this into a fresh landing (§12).
                                       #   install-default wires tracker + delivery + builtin plugins,
                                       #   so they are ordinary entries in the landing list — no
                                       #   runtime defaults. Replace this folder = replace the default
                                       #   capability set (policy in config, not core code).

$XDG_STATE_HOME/balls/
  plugins/<name>/<plugin-territory>/   # each plugin owns one subtree
    tracker/<pct-enc-remote>/          #   tracker: a clone tracking the store branch (.git/ tasks/)
    <delivery>/<pct-enc-local>/<id>/   #   delivery: the code worktree for task <id> (see §11)

  clones/<pct-enc-local-path>/         # per-invocation-path binding
    binding.toml                       #   tracker remote (if any) + invocation_path + tasks_branch
    config/                            #   the LANDING — balls/config checkout (real, path-derived)
    tasks/                             #   the STORE — tasks_branch checkout; local (stealth) or a
                                       #     worktree tracking tracker/<remote>/ when remote-backed
    changes/<uuid>/                    #   in-flight CHANGE worktrees (core, ephemeral, one per op)
    log                                #   the unified op log: JSON-lines, balls-owned (§4/§6)
```

- URLs and paths are **percent-encoded, never hashed**, so directory names stay inspectable.
- `config/` and `tasks/` are SEPARATE checkouts of the two branches. There is NO `operating/` symlink
  and no terminus to resolve: config is read from `config/`, tasks from `tasks/` (named by
  `tasks_branch`, §4). If `tasks_branch` names the landing, the two checkouts coincide on one branch
  whose `config/` and `tasks/` folders simply both live there — same code path (§2).
- The CHANGE worktree (`changes/<uuid>/`) is core, uuid-named (nothing keys off the uuid), off the
  STORE for task ops and off the landing for `config`/`install` ops (§8). It is distinct from the
  delivery plugin's CODE worktree (§11), which lives in plugin territory and checks out the *project*
  repo.
- Two clones sharing one store remote share one `plugins/tracker/<remote>/` dir.
- **`log` is ONE unified per-clone op log** (not a per-plugin or per-op-phase tree): JSON-lines, one
  object per line `{ts, lvl, src, op, phase, msg}` with `src ∈ {core, <plugin>}`. balls owns the
  format — the source is a stamped FIELD, so you grep one source or read the whole sequence; metrics
  (§6) compose over it. It is local runtime state, gitignored, never on a committed branch (like
  `binding.toml`) — which the §4 "landing cannot be published" rule makes doubly correct. One object
  per line keeps concurrent appends from parallel agents atomic (sub-`PIPE_BUF`, `O_APPEND`). Stale-
  but-harmless like an orphan worktree: no core rotation/retention; prune is
  manual; the `log_level` knob (§4) limits volume instead. Scope is per-clone (per invocation-path),
  so one timeline covers both this clone's store *and* landing ops.

## §2 Branch layout — two branches, folder-namespaced

State rides TWO branches, each one job, each its own transport discipline (§0/§6):

```
balls/config   (the LANDING — path-derived, single-owner, install-transport)
  config/balls.toml                      # balls config (§4), incl. tasks_branch
  config/plugins.toml                    # the hook schedule (§4/§6): [hooks] <op>.<phase> = ordered name list
  config/plugins/<name>/...              # each plugin's config; balls never reads it
  config/plugins/bin/<name>              # local, gitignored: absolute symlink to this box's binary

balls/tasks    (the STORE — named by config.tasks_branch, shared, sync-transport)
  tasks/<id>.md                          # one file per task; <id> IS the filename basename
```

- **`config/` and `tasks/` are top-level folders, ALWAYS** — on every branch, in either role. This
  is what makes the split free: the code reads `config/` from the landing ref and `tasks/` from the
  `tasks_branch` ref with NO branching on whether those refs are equal. One-vs-two branches is just
  whether the two names coincide — not a code path. Point `tasks_branch` at the landing (or run both
  roles on one branch) and it Just Works: the two folders coexist. balls does NOT block on branch
  names.
- **Default-two.** `tasks_branch` defaults to a DISTINCT ref (`balls/tasks`), because two single-job
  branches are simplest and fewest code paths (§0). Reuse is legal but a deliberate choice with its
  own costs (§6): a config ref shared as another clone's store couples their cadences and carries
  baggage; a config ref shared AS config between clones CORRUPTS, having no merge.
- The landing branch is path-derived (`balls/config`) and is never named by config — you read config
  FROM it, so it cannot name where it lives. `tasks_branch` is the one indirection (§4): the single
  fixed point (the landing) plus the single pointer (to the store).

No archive directory. Closed/dropped balls **delete** their `tasks/<id>.md`; history lives in
`git log` (`git log --diff-filter=D -- tasks/<id>.md`; `bl show <id>` reconstructs from history).

## §3 Task schema (one node type)

There is exactly one node type: **task**. `epic`/`issue`/`gate`/`bug` are *tags* with zero core
behavior; any "epic" rendering is emergent from the task having children (§10).

`tasks/<id>.md` — TOML frontmatter (fenced by `+++`), then a free-form markdown body. Core writes the
canonical serializer form: scalars first, each blocker a `[[blockers]]` table last.

```markdown
+++
title = "Refactor the foo system"
created = 1748357520                        # unix seconds; storage/transit is ALWAYS unix-time
updated = 1748443920                        # only display renders ISO-8601 (§9), never storage
claimant = "orionriver@gmail.com"           # occupancy: present ⇒ claimed, absent ⇒ unclaimed. NO status field
parent = "bl-1000"
priority = 2                                # optional; lower = higher priority; absent sorts LAST
tags = ["refactor", "infra"]

[[blockers]]                                # the relational primitive (§10), one table per edge
id = "bl-1100"
on = "claim"                                # can't be CLAIMED until bl-1100 resolves (dependency)

[[blockers]]
id = "bl-1200"
on = "close"                                # can't be CLOSED until bl-1200 resolves (gate)
+++

Free-form markdown body.
```

**Format (TOML everywhere).** Frontmatter and config (§4) are both TOML — one serializer, pure-Rust, no C
dependency. TOML earns its keep where humans hand-edit (config comments survive; `bl` rarely rewrites
config) and costs nothing where they don't (task files are `bl`-written, so block-form `[[blockers]]`
and comment-erasure on rewrite are immaterial). It exports deterministically and losslessly to JSON for
external tooling via `toml::Value → serde_json` — the i64 timestamps sidestep TOML's lone non-JSON type
(native datetime). Chosen over YAML (a C libyaml dependency) and JSON-everywhere (which loses config
comments).

- **No `id:` field.** The id is the filename basename of `tasks/<id>.md`, the sole source of truth
  (Model A — "id IS the path, not a field"). One token; `git log -- tasks/<id>.md` and `tasks/`
  greps work by id. (Rejected Model B — opaque-uuid filename + id field — because it forces an
  index for `bl show <id>`; never introduce an index unless it is the core basis of the app.)
- **No `state`/`status` field (bl-4778, RESOLVED).** A live ball's status is a DERIVED VIEW —
  computed on read by a short-circuit ladder, never stored, each value named for the VERB/question it
  answers:
  1. `claimant` set ⇒ **claimed** (someone holds it). Claim-blockers are NOT evaluated here — once a
     ball is claimed, whether it *could* have been claimed is moot.
  2. else an unresolved claim-blocker ⇒ **blocked** (not startable yet).
  3. else ⇒ **ready** — claimable now. This is exactly the `ready()` predicate (§10); "ready" is the
     question we ask of a ball, so it is the word shown, not "open".

  Exactly THREE live-ball states (closed/dropped are not states — the file is gone; `bl-op` in the
  log says which, §9). **"blocked" means claim-blockers ONLY.** A close-blocker (gate/PR) yields NO
  status — a claimed ball with an open close-gate is just **claimed**. This is the same insight that
  abolished `review`: "in review" was never a functional state, only "claimed, with a close-blocker that core enforces at close" (§9/§10). A stored status field would have ZERO core behavior (no
  transition matrix; `ready()` never reads it), making it indistinguishable from a single-valued tag
  — so it folds away. Non-deriving human intent (`deferred`, `icebox`, `triage`) is an ordinary `tag`
  (§3), not a status. `bl list`'s status column RENDERS the ladder; nothing writes it. **Two
  projections, one source (bl-d074).** The DEFAULT human render (`bl show`/`list`/`ready`) freely
  paints DERIVED columns — the status ladder, the tree, ISO-8601 dates — none of them stored. `--json`
  is the orthogonal **bedrock** projection: the lossless mirror of stored frontmatter ONLY, never a
  derived field, so "show me what's actually there" stays uncontaminated and round-trip-safe. A machine
  integrator therefore reads bedrock `--json` (`claimant` + `blockers` — already present) and runs the
  same short ladder core runs; no stored `status` is needed, so a denormalizing default `status` plugin
  folds away (bl-d074 RESOLVED by subtraction, §15). Old balls' 6-variant status enum collapses to
  `claimant` + `blockers` + tags, status computed on read. (A team wanting a stored, ordered pipeline —
  or the gate/PR `in_review` distinction core deliberately folds into "claimed" — opts in OUTSIDE core:
  an unknown `state:` key is preserved on writeback per the last bullet, read by their own display
  plugin — severable, never a core field.)
- **`claimant`** — the OCCUPANCY field and its SOLE source of truth: absent ⇒ unclaimed, present ⇒
  claimed. The one hardcoded guard (§0 — claim refuses an already-claimed ball) reads `claimant`,
  the structured field, so claim-correctness needs no status vocabulary at all. `claim` sets it,
  `unclaim`/`drop`/`close` clear it (close/drop by deleting the whole file).
- **`parent`** — containment/tree pointer only; scanned for display (`bl show` tree), never for
  enforcement. Arbitrary depth.
- **`priority`** (optional int) — the one ordering input. Unlike `status` (folded because `ready()`
  never reads it), priority has genuine core behavior: `bl ready` ORDERS the ready set by it, and no
  other field can derive an order — so it does NOT pass the "zero core behavior ⇒ fold" test and
  stays a core field. Lower = higher priority; **absent sorts LAST** (a no-priority ball is lower
  than any priority). Ordering is display-only — never part of the `ready()` predicate (§10).
- **`blockers: [{id, on}]`** — the relational primitive (§10), stored on the BLOCKED task. `on` is
  ANY op name (`claim`/`close`/`update`/`drop`/…): the op of *this* task whose `.pre` is rejected
  while `id` is unresolved (`.pre` is implicit — blocking is always a pre-op rejection). NOT an enum —
  `claim` (dependency) and `close` (gate) are merely the two cases with create-time sugar (§10); the
  primitive itself gates any op. Subsumes the old `deps`/`gates` link types — they were one edge
  parameterized by `on`. Pure-metadata links (`relates_to`, `supersedes`, `duplicates`, `replies_to`)
  remain core metadata with no enforcement.
- **`created`/`updated` are unix-time (i64 seconds)** — storage and transit are ALWAYS unix-time; only
  display renders ISO-8601 (§9). A timestamp is just an int, so the storage layer needs no date library,
  the value is timezone-unambiguous and numerically sortable, and the TOML→JSON export stays lossless.
  `claimant`, `priority`, `tags` optional. Unknown keys preserved on writeback (this is the opt-in seam
  for a team's own `state:`/pipeline field). Terminal ops delete the file (§9).

## §4 Config schema

Config's durable, committed home is the landing (`balls/config`); it is NEVER read from the store and
NEVER layered down a trail (there is no trail — §12). The EFFECTIVE config is the landing overlaid by
two local-trusted layers — the per-machine XDG file and CLI flags — and that whole LOCAL stack is the
sole authority for what runs and where it syncs (§0): no remote is ever authoritative. A center's
config reaches you only by `install` copying it INTO the landing, where it becomes local (§6).
**Read layers, innermost wins:**
1. CLI flags
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/balls/config.toml` (per-machine, local-trusted)
3. `config/balls.toml` on the landing
4. Built-in serde fallback (absent fields only)

**Defaults are seeded, not run-time.** A fresh landing is populated at prime by copying the app-level
`default-config/` folder (§1/§12) — so the landing's `config/balls.toml` and plugin wiring (tracker,
delivery, builtin plugins) come from the SEED, as ordinary committed entries. The "built-in" layer 4
is only the serde fallback for a field no layer set. There is no run-time default plugin set and no
magic capability: everything that runs is a literal entry the seed (or a later `install`) wrote.

XDG and the seed are LOCAL trust — your own machine — never a remote input. A center's config reaches
you ONLY by `bl install` (§6) copying it into your landing, with consent. **This retires the old §4
trail-layer:** config values no longer shadow down a chain of checkouts; the adoption happens ONCE, at
explicit install, materialized into the landing. **All config is treated as potential RCE** (§0):
`install` IS the consent boundary; auto-layering leaked around it (a shadowed `tasks_branch` could
silently redirect where you write — config is not as inert as "data, not code" implied).

**Merge semantics:** scalar/object fields — innermost layer fully replaces outer. List fields —
bare `<field>` = full replacement; compose with `<field>_prepend` / `<field>_append` / `<field>_ban`.
The `[hooks]` lists in `config/plugins.toml` (§6) ARE list fields, layered the same way — a landing's
schedule composes with an XDG `_prepend`/`_append`/`_ban`, and `bl install` copies the file like any
other config (never inherited down a trail — there is none, §12). An absent/empty hook list = run nothing.

**The landing is single-owner — and balls cannot publish it.** Config's transport is a path-copy
mirror (§6 install), which has NO cross-writer merge, so two writers to one config branch clobber.
Single-ownership is therefore STRUCTURAL, not disciplinary: the only component that pushes is the
tracker, and it pushes ONLY `tasks_branch` (§13) — nothing in balls ever puts the landing in a push
refspec, so `balls/config` physically cannot leave the box through balls. The landing is path-derived
per-checkout (a different fixed point per clone) and is NEVER a sync target (§13). The one residue
balls cannot police is a human running raw `git push origin balls/config` by hand — outside balls'
surface, the same way `rm -rf .balls` is. Sharing a config branch between clones corrupts; only the
STORE (`tasks_branch`) is shareable, because only it is sync-merged (§6/§12).

**Built-in fields:**
- `tasks_branch` (string, default `"balls/tasks"`) — the branch whose `tasks/` is this checkout's
  store. The one config→store indirection ("config tells us where the tasks are"). A local-only value
  is stealth; the remote that backs it is the tracker's own config (§0 — core names no remote). The
  landing branch itself is path-derived (`balls/config`), NOT a config field (bootstrap fixed point).
- `log_level` (string, default `"info"`) — the single threshold for the unified op log (§1/§6),
  applied at WRITE time so it gates BOTH file persistence and terminal echo (a line below threshold is
  never emitted anywhere). A serde-default scalar like `tasks_branch` — NOT a `default-config/` seed
  entry and NOT a "run-time default" carve-out: the seed is for capability *sets* (the plugin chain),
  the layer-4 serde fallback is exactly "for a field no layer set." Read order is the normal §4 stack,
  so `--log-level` (layer 1) overrides for one run. Default mapping: core narrates mutating-op
  lifecycle at `info` and read-op narration (`show`/`list`/`ready`) at `debug`, so default-`info`
  keeps read chatter out of the log; plugin-enveloped stderr is `info`.

The id scheme is deliberately NOT a config field — it is fixed (§ id generation): a team wanting a
different scheme supplies a `create/pre` plugin, not a config knob.

No state-related config exists at all (bl-4778, RESOLVED): **no `default_state`, no `states` vocab
list, no per-op state-target knob.** There is no `state` field for them to configure (§3) — status
is derived from `claimant`/`blockers`/file-existence, and human intent is a `tag`. The whole cluster
was rejected as the §0 "new field is a smell": claim writes no status, so there is no target to seed
or override; a team wanting an ordered pipeline opts in outside core (an unknown `state:` key + a
display plugin, §3). The plugin chain, by contrast, **IS a config list** — `config/plugins.toml`'s
`[hooks]` table (§6), layered like every other field (§4). The filesystem holds only the local,
gitignored `bin/<name>` binary symlinks; the *schedule* — which plugin runs in which op-phase, in what
order — is config, not a directory tree (a list is sortable; a directory needs `NN-` prefixes to fake it).

## §5 Commit-message protocol

Every change-attempt commit is `subject / body / trailer-block`, where the trailer block is a
**standard git trailer paragraph** (last blank-line-separated paragraph, `key: value` lines,
parsed via `git interpret-trailers --parse` — no hand-rolled parser; coexists with
`Co-Authored-By:`):

```
<subject — defaults to the ball's title; -m overrides>

<free-form body, optional>

bl-protocol: 1
bl-op: close
bl-id: bl-1234
bl-actor: orionriver@gmail.com
```

- Tokens are lower-kebab (`[a-z0-9-]`, git's trailer grammar). The subject is the ball title so
  `git log` readers never see balls-flavored subjects.
- **Namespacing:** every key is namespaced by owner. `bl-` is RESERVED to core (plugins may not
  emit `bl-*`); plugins prefix with their own name (`jira-id`, `github-url`).
- balls always writes `bl-protocol`, `bl-op`, `bl-actor`; `bl-id` on every per-task op
  (`create`/`claim`/`unclaim`/`update`/`close`/`drop`), absent on the checkout-scoped ops
  (`prime`/`sync`/`install`/`config`) which name no single ball. **No `bl-from-state`/`bl-to-state`
  trailers** (bl-4778) — there is no status field to transition; `bl-op` already names the op
  (`close` vs `drop` distinguishes the two terminal flavors in the log), and the `claimant` change
  rides as an ordinary frontmatter diff.
- Repeated key → list (git-native; no comma-splitting). Unknown keys are never dropped — parsed
  into `metadata` and forwarded to plugins on the invoke wire (§7).

## §6 Plugin contract & dispatch

A plugin is a single binary, dispatched **subprocess-uniform** — no in-process path, no privileged
plugins. The shipped `tracker` and delivery plugins are fully separate binaries, in-repo only as
default capabilities + reference implementations, invoked identically to any third party. `bl
plugin <name> <op> <phase>` is the canonical dispatch and balls dogfoods it.

```
<bin> protocol
  → stdout (JSON): { protocol: <version(s)>, ops: [...] }   # self-description; balls never persists it
  → exit 0

<bin> <op> <phase>
  cwd:    the CHANGE worktree (mutating ops) or the relevant checkout (reads: store / landing)
  env:    BALLS_PROTOCOL=1, BALLS_PLUGIN_NAME=<name>, BALLS_PLUGIN_DEPTH=<n>
  stdin:  payload (§7)
  stdout: the plugin's USER-FACING channel — balls forwards it to the invoker's stdout verbatim
          and PARSES NOTHING back into state (no return channel; see §7). A plugin that produces a
          user-relevant value (the delivery plugin's worktree path, a forge PR URL) PRINTS IT HERE;
          core neither computes nor consumes it. "claim prints the worktree path" is exactly this —
          the delivery plugin printing, not core knowing the path.
  stderr: the plugin's diagnostic channel. The plugin stays DUMB — it writes raw stderr and is told
          nothing about where it lands (no BALLS_LOG_DIR; a new env is a §0 smell). balls pipes the
          child's stderr and ENVELOPES each line as a JSON-lines record into clones/<enc>/log
          (`src=<name>`, the op/phase, `lvl=info`), interleaved with core's own lifecycle records.
          Structured (non-diagnostic) artifacts a plugin wants go to its OWN territory
          (plugins/<name>/, §1), derived from BALLS_PLUGIN_NAME — never the shared log.
  exit:   0 = ok; non-zero = abort + roll prior plugins back in reverse. On a non-zero exit core
          additionally emits an `error` record (op/phase/name/exit) so the failure locus survives any
          `log_level` threshold (§4) even when the plugin's own info-level stderr is filtered out.
```

**Metrics are a query, not core state.** balls stores and emits no metrics: the unified `log` (§1) is
the event stream — every op/phase/plugin record is timestamped — and the §5 commit trailers are the
durable history. Counters/timing compose over those by `jq`/parse, or a `*.post` plugin observes the
lifecycle and writes to its own territory. There is no metric seam to add: the hook list + this
dispatch + the §7 payload IS the subscription, and a plugin times an op by stamping its own clock
across the `pre`/`post` it already runs. No core storage, ever.

**The hook list is config.** `config/plugins.toml`'s `[hooks]` table on the landing (§2) is the single
source of truth for wiring: a `<op>.<phase>` key maps to an ORDERED LIST of plugin names — listed = run
this plugin in this op-phase; **list position = run order** (the last name runs last). An absent key or
empty list = run nothing (the general path with no entries, not a special case). It is layered + merged
exactly like the rest of config (§4) — a center's schedule composes with an XDG `_prepend`/`_append`/
`_ban` and travels by `bl install` — so there is NO parallel filesystem-registry mechanism; ordering is
a list property, not an `NN-` filename convention faking one.

```toml
[hooks]
"sync.pre"     = ["tracker"]                  # import remote state first
"prime.pre"    = ["tracker"]
"prime.post"   = ["bl-delivery"]              # re-materialize still-claimed worktrees
"claim.post"   = ["bl-delivery", "tracker"]   # worktree, then the push (tracker last)
"unclaim.post" = ["bl-delivery", "tracker"]
"close.pre"    = ["bl-delivery"]              # deliver (squash) before the seal
"close.post"   = ["bl-delivery", "tracker"]   # teardown, then push
"drop.post"    = ["bl-delivery", "tracker"]
"create.post"  = ["tracker"]
"update.post"  = ["tracker"]
```

Schedule (committed text) and binary (local symlink) split cleanly:
- COMMITTED (travels with the branch / `bl install`): the `[hooks]` list names plugins by NAME — pure
  text, portable verbatim, valid in stealth and federation regardless of where the checkout sits.
- LOCAL (never committed, gitignored): `config/plugins/bin/<name>` is an ABSOLUTE symlink → this
  machine's binary. Installing a plugin drops this symlink; dispatch resolves a hooked NAME to it. A
  dangling/absent `bin/<name>` = a clean "plugin referenced but not installed here" error.

**`bl install` — copy a committed path between branches.** `bl install <path> --from <ref> --to <ref>`
makes `<ref-to>/<path>` byte-identical to `<ref-from>/<path>`, touching NOTHING outside `<path>`,
committed atomically to `--to`. Defaults: `--to` the landing, `--from` the configured upstream; **bare
`bl install` (no path) = `config/` EXCLUDING `tasks/`** (the recommended bundle — `balls.toml` +
`plugins.toml` + plugin config, never the store). `<ref>` is any synced repo/branch. There is **no object enum and no
merge-vs-replace logic** — install is path-copy, and the path's *shape* decides the semantics:

- **Folder path = MIRROR (deletions propagate).** `bl install tasks` makes the destination's `tasks/`
  identical to the source's — entries the source lacks are REMOVED (wipe-and-replace, rsync-`--delete`,
  NOT `cp` semantics). `install config` / `install plugins.toml` / `install plugins/<name>` each
  replace exactly that subtree or file. This is how a close/drop (a file deletion) PROPAGATES through `install tasks` —
  the resurrection problem is dissolved by addressing, no tombstone mechanism needed.
- **File / glob path = UNION (additive, source-wins on overlap).** `bl install tasks/*` copies each
  source file in and leaves the destination's other files alone; `bl install tasks/bl-1234.md` ports
  one task. A same-`id` is OVERWRITTEN, NOT conflicted — there is no conflict detection; git is the
  recovery net. A deliberate sharp edge: `install tasks` is a hard wipe, `install tasks/*` a union; the
  skill doc states it. (This is the one counterintuitive case — folder ≠ `cp`.) Mitigation is honesty,
  not a guard: install commits, so every deletion is git-recoverable, and install PRINTS its change
  summary (`N added / M deleted`) on stdout — the blast radius is visible before you trust it, and
  `git diff` reviews it after. No confirmation flag (a new flag is a smell, §0); the commit IS the undo.
- **Siblings are never touched.** install builds its commit on top of `--to`'s current tip, swapping
  only `<path>` — it NEVER rebuilds the tip from the source's whole tree and NEVER resets the ref. So
  `install config` can never eat a co-resident `tasks/` (if `tasks_branch` names the same branch, §2):
  forbidden, not merely discouraged. More-specific paths are less destructive — scope the blast radius.
- **Committed tree only, never `bin/`.** A path-copy of the committed tree cannot include `bin/<name>`
  (gitignored, not in the tree), so publishing to another repo (`--from landing --to <center>`) ships a
  *recommendation* (a dangling `bin/` the recipient resolves locally), never runnable code. Adopting
  (`--to landing`) and publishing are the same verb, reversed. Re-homing the store = a `tasks_branch`
  edit + `install tasks` (mirror, to an empty home) or `install tasks/*` (union, into a populated one),
  §12.
- **Local binary resolution.** When `--to` is the local landing, install resolves each named plugin's
  `bin/<name>` against this machine (PATH or explicit `--bin <name>=<path>`) and validates it against
  the live `<plugin> protocol` (refuses to link an op or protocol version the binary doesn't declare).
  Still validated per binary, still user-in-the-loop: the consent-gated path for federated onboarding
  (§12). (`bl install` subsumes the older `bl plugin install <name> <path>` and `--from <branch>`
  spellings.)

- **Invocation-tree cap (the runaway backstop):** every nested `bl` — a plugin shelling back, an op
  triggering another op, a clone spawning a clone — runs as a descendant process and inherits one
  depth odometer (`BALLS_PLUGIN_DEPTH`, bumped once per nested invocation whatever its SOURCE; plugin
  recursion is just ONE dimension of it, clone-spawn another). A single built-in cap bounds the
  odometer along any root-to-leaf path. **Crossing the cap ABORTS the op — fail, not silent:** core
  rolls the run plugins back in reverse order (§8/§14) and emits a diagnostic naming the op/plugin
  chain that overran, so the loop SURFACES instead of hiding. (The retired disposition — "run
  PLUGIN-FREE at the cap, suppressed not refused" — was the worst option: it converted a runaway into
  quiet wrong-behavior, the offending plugin getting no signal and the op silently running without the
  plugins it expected.) The cap is the general failback for UNBOUNDED RECURSION in any dimension: a
  plugin wired on op X whose handler runs `bl X` (self-retrigger — the common bug), recursive
  clone-spawning, and mutual `plugin1`↔`plugin2` loops are all the one odometer crossing the one cap.
  A BOUNDED chain never nears it — forge `claim.post` running `bl create` for the gate child goes 1
  deep and never re-triggers its own op. There is no hatch to re-enable plugins on a nested call (it
  would let a runaway defeat its own backstop). A plugin SHOULD NOT re-trigger its own op; §0 already
  bars a plugin from depending on another plugin's presence (the mutual half). Finer-grained per-op
  controls can layer ON TOP; this cap is the failback under them.
- **Snapshot:** an op reads the effective `[hooks]` schedule at op-start and uses that frozen set;
  an install landing mid-op affects only the next op.
- **Reads are not special-cased.** Every op (incl. `show`/`list`) has a hook key; reads stay
  plugin-free in PRACTICE only because nothing is listed for them by default.

## §7 Plugin wire payloads

Plugins get meaning directly on the wire — content + intent, not hashes to reverse-engineer.
**There is no return channel:** a plugin contributes by EDITING THE CHANGE WORKTREE (the ball file,
frontmatter, a `git mv`), never by printing values for balls to merge. stdout is diagnostics. Two
plugins writing the same field is two filesystem writes — last writer wins, where "last" is the
hook-list order; balls neither arbitrates nor tracks ownership.

**pre payload (stdin):** `protocol`, `op`/`phase`, `plugin_name`, `actor`, `binding`
(`{ remote, tasks_branch, store, landing, invocation_path }` — `store`/`landing` are the two checkout
paths (§1), `tasks_branch` names the store branch (§4), `invocation_path` is where `bl` was invoked,
the project-repo root the delivery plugin needs, §11), `command` (`op` + intended `field_changes` +
`body_change`), `current_state` (`null` on create). The id is NOT on the pre wire (it is not sealed
yet — a reassigning plugin reads it from the single staged `tasks/*.md`).

**post payload (stdin):** same plus `commit`/`previous_commit`, the final `command`, `metadata`
(parsed from the §5 trailer block, incl. the now-sealed `bl-id`), and `previous_state`/`current_state`
(`null` for create / close-drop respectively).

**rollback payload:** the shape of the op being undone plus `rolling_back: pre|post`; the plugin
tracks its own intermediate state (§11 rollback is the worked derived-state example; general rule §14).

## §8 Op lifecycle

balls runs TWO families of op, and they are deliberately NOT forced into one shape. Don't read the
sequence below as universal — it is the **task-op** shape; the rest inherit what generalizes and no
more.

**Task ops — the symmetric family** (`create`/`claim`/`update`/`close`/`drop`): **balls authors a base
change, an ordered plugin chain acts on it, balls seals it, plugins react.** The boundary is the SEAL —
`commit + integrate`, atomic: **pre** modifiers shape what gets sealed (the record isn't fixed yet);
**post** reactors act on the now-landed record and MUST NOT mutate the ball (it is sealed). One commit
per op, sealed to the STORE. This is the canonical sequence (below), and it is fully symmetric across
the five verbs — they differ only in which fields the base change stages.

**Everything else inherits partially — a spectrum, not the same shape:**
- **`config` / `install`** keep the sealing shape but seal to the LANDING, not the store; `install`'s
  "base change" is a path-copy (§6), not a staged frontmatter edit, and it carries none of the
  task-shaped wire fields (`current_state`, `field_changes`). Symmetric in skeleton, different in
  target and mechanics.
- **`sync` / `prime`** (§13) author NO diff at all, so there is no change worktree and
  no core seal. They inherit only what generalizes — the `pre`→`post` hook spine in hook-list order,
  reverse-order rollback, and the §7 wire minus its task fields — and do their own work where the seal
  would be: `sync`'s integration is the tracker's fetch+ff, owned by a PLUGIN not core (remote-talk is
  plugin-exclusive, §0/§13); `prime` orchestrates syncs + substrate.
  Their hooks run against the live store/landing checkout directly.

The canonical task-op sequence (verb-agnostic):

1. **balls makes the place to work + authors the base** — the CHANGE worktree (off the STORE for task
   ops, off the landing for `config`/`install` ops),
   into which balls STAGES the op's base change (create stages a provisional `tasks/<id>.md` with a
   default-generated id; claim stages `claimant`). balls goes first; plugins extend/override.
   (For `prime`'s bootstrap-on-miss it makes the landing repo instead — the substrate-creation phase;
   `prime` is a normal op, not a dispatch exception.)
2. **pre modifiers run in hook-list order** — the §7 wire (current state + intent). They edit the shared
   worktree (rename the ball file to reassign an id, edit frontmatter) or REJECT. They see each
   other's cumulative FILE state, never each other's commits (§7) — there are no intermediate commits.
3. **balls SEALS — commit + integrate, atomically** — validate, commit the worktree with the §5
   trailer (re-reading the tree to learn the final id/state), and integrate it onto its target branch
   (the STORE for task ops, the landing for `config`/`install`) as ONE act. *This is the pre/post
   boundary; after it the record is durably on that branch.*
4. **post reactors run in hook-list order** — the §7 wire with the sealed `bl-id`/state. They act on the
   landed record (tracker pushes the store; the delivery plugin acts on the project repo) but DO NOT edit
   the ball — anything that had to live on the ball was written in pre; post-only values are DERIVED,
   never written back (§11 `delivered_in`). The outermost irreversible effect (the push) sorts LAST.
5. **teardown** — balls removes the change worktree (its content is already integrated).
6. **failure / rollback (§14)** — any non-zero `pre`/`post` exit aborts: core calls `rollback` on each
   already-run plugin in REVERSE order, then UN-SEALS its own change (discard the un-sealed worktree on
   a pre abort; `git reset` the target branch on a post abort — local, reversible, nothing core-pushed).
   Each plugin's rollback decides what undoing means; persistence-through-abort is a plugin choosing a
   no-op rollback (§14), not a core carve-out.

## §9 Verbs

Deliverable lifecycle verbs: **`create` (`bl new`), `claim`, `unclaim`, `update`, `close`, `drop`.**
There is **no `review` verb** — see "close" below.

Read verbs (no seal, no change worktree — hook dirs only, §13): **`show`, `list`, `ready`,
`dep tree`.** They author no ball-file diff; their whole contribution is what the hook
chain prints (§7). `--json` on any read verb is the lossless **bedrock** projection — raw stored
fields only, no derived value (the round-trippable "what's actually there", §3); the default human
render is the orthogonal projection that carries the derived columns (the status ladder, the tree,
ISO-8601 dates).

Checkout-lifecycle verbs (the checkout itself, not a ball): **`prime`, `sync`, `install`** (§13, §6).
**There is no `init` verb** — it retired into idempotent `prime` (§12): founding is just `prime`'s
bootstrap-on-miss path. `prime` makes the checkout ready (substrate + onboarding + worktree
re-materialization, seeding a fresh landing from the app `default-config/` folder — §12); `sync` keeps
it current (data only); `install` copies a committed path between branches (§6 — config/plugins adopt
or publish; the recommended bundle is `config/` minus `tasks/`).

**`create`** (op `create`; no prior state): balls generates a default-scheme id (§ id generation)
and stages `tasks/<id>.md` (title, timestamps, optional `parent`/`priority` (`-p`)/`tags`, plus any
`blockers` edges spelled out by `--blocks`/`--needs` — §10; `--parent` adds containment only, no
blocker; no status field is written, §3). A `create/pre`
plugin may reject or *reassign*
the id by `git mv`-ing the single staged `tasks/*.md` (it discovers the current name by reading
that file, never hardcoding — so reassigns compose under hook-list order). balls validates (exactly one
new `tasks/*.md`; regex-valid; no collision) and commits.

**`claim`** (acquire occupancy; core's guards refuse a ball whose `claimant` is already set, or whose claim-blockers are unresolved — `!ready()`, §10): stage `claimant`, bump `updated` — the ONLY field it writes. There is no status to set:
"claimed" is the derived view of `claimant` (§3), so claim stores the one occupancy fact in the one
field. `claim.post`: the delivery plugin materializes the code worktree AND prints its path (§11 — the
plugin owns the path and prints it on stdout, §6; core forwards, never computes it).

**`unclaim`** (release occupancy): clear `claimant` (symmetric with claim — the only field touched).
`*.post`: the delivery plugin releases the code worktree.

**`update`** (op `update`): the generic field/body edit — retitle, edit the markdown body, add/remove
`tags`, reparent, edit `blockers`. (No status to set — that field doesn't exist, §3; a team's opt-in
`state:` key, being an unknown preserved field, rides through `update` like any other.) balls stages
the edit; `update.pre` may reject/adjust; seal; `update.post` reactors propagate (the tracker pushes;
an external-mirror plugin reflects the new title). claim / unclaim / close / drop are NAMED
specializations of `update` (they fix specific fields and, for close/drop, stage a deletion) — kept
as distinct ops because the op NAME is the §6 hook-dispatch key, so a plugin wires into `claim.post`
rather than sniffing "an update that set `claimant`."

**`close`** (retire a claimed ball) — **deliver + retire across the seal boundary; this is what `review`
used to gesture at.** A task's deliverable life is claim → write code → DELIVER → RETIRE; in the
self-merge default DELIVER and RETIRE are one act:
- `close.pre`: (1) the delivery plugin DELIVERS — direct: squashes `work/<id>` → integration (conflicts
  surface HERE), sorting LAST so its un-squash rollback is rare; forge: idempotently pushes `work/<id>`
  + opens/updates the PR (rollback is a no-op — a pushed branch + open PR is the correct in-review
  state, §11). (2) core rejects if any close-blocker is open — `closeable()` false (§10) — for forge that is the claim-time approval gate child, so an unmerged PR simply leaves close blocked. The check is abort-safe: evaluated before delivery and the seal, a blocked or failed close aborts BEFORE the ball-deletion seals, so the task stays alive.
- balls seals the `tasks/<id>.md` DELETION (`bl-op: close`).
- `close.post`: the delivery plugin tears down the code worktree (§11); the tracker pushes the
  balls-state deletion commit (NEVER the project code branch).

Core close ships no code, pushes no project remote, runs no source-state check. Forge review is **not
a mode** — it is the ordinary close plus an approval gate child the forge plugin adds at claim
(§10/§11), enforced by core's close-blocker guard (§10). "Close is related to remotes" = the tracker
pushes the *balls* branch, nothing more.

**`drop`** (abandon a ball — terminal) is identical mechanics to close: it clears occupancy and seals
a `tasks/<id>.md` DELETION, the only difference being intent, carried by `bl-op: drop` (which is also
what the log uses to tell an abandoned ball from a completed one — §5, no status field needed). Its
`drop.post` releases the code worktree (and, for forge, tears down the PR/branch — §11).

## §10 Blocker & gating model

The one relational primitive is the **blocker** (§3): a `{id, on}` edge on the BLOCKED task naming
which of its own ops is gated. `on` is ANY op; `claim` and `close` are simply the two cases with
create-time sugar (front-door flags below). **Blocking is fully separate from containment** — a
`parent` pointer is display only and gates NOTHING. An edge gates a transition ONLY because you
created that edge; nothing is implied. This is the load-bearing subtraction: the old `--parent`
silently minted a claim-blocker, conflating "lives under" with "gates," which is what produced the
late-add gaps. Now every edge is explicit and says exactly what it gates.

- **dependency** = a claim-blocker ("can't START until it resolves").
- **gate** = a close-blocker ("can't FINISH until it resolves"). Build/test/approval/forge/review are
  all this — a "review gate" is not a mechanism, it is `--blocks close` plus a skill-doc convention.
- **epic** = a task with children — a pure CONTAINMENT/display rollup, emergent from `parent`
  pointers, gating NOTHING by itself. If you want "the epic can't START until its children land,"
  add a `claim` edge per child (`--blocks claim`); if "can't FINISH until they land," a `close` edge
  (`--blocks close`); if neither, the epic is freely claimable and closeable alongside open children
  (their `parent:` simply dangles — display-only, §3 — never corruption). The presumptive pattern is
  a skill-doc hint, not a core rule.

**ready(A)** = A is live (file exists — not closed/dropped) + unclaimed + every CLAIM-blocker
resolved. ready(A) true is exactly the **ready** display state (§3); claimed and blocked are the
other two. `bl ready` ORDERS the ready set by `priority` ascending (lower = higher; absent last),
then `created` ascending — ordering is display-only, never part of the predicate (§3). (A gate child is a live child that does NOT affect readiness — it's a close-blocker, so it
never shows as a status either.) **closeable(A)** = every CLOSE-blocker resolved; checked by core at close. "Resolved" = the blocker is closed OR dropped.

**Deadlock avoidance is now structural-by-default.** Because no edge is ever auto-minted (containment
implies none), the reciprocal edge that would deadlock is simply never created unless you spell out
both halves yourself. The standard gate is ONE edge — a gate child close-blocks its parent; the parent
does NOT block the gate child, so the gate is freely claimable. The gate-check runs against the
parent's pre-delivery WORK BRANCH (which exists once the parent is claimed), so nothing needs the
parent formally "done" — no `review` window is resurrected. "Do the gate after the parent's work" is a
skill habit, deliberately UNENFORCED. A cycle is now only reachable by explicitly authoring both
edges; it is still not gated by code (links are mutable — unlink to fix). Readiness is immediate-only
(a blocker resolves when its file is gone, not transitively), so a cycle never drives a recursive
walk: it simply manifests as mutual permanent-block, and `claim` refuses naming the unresolved
blocker, which `bl update` then unlinks.

**Enforcement is CORE.** Core stores the schema (`parent`, `blockers`, `tags`) AND enforces every
blocker (the `.pre` of the named `on` op rejects while unresolved), joining the one occupancy guard
(`claim` refuses an already-claimed ball) as core's small fixed set of hardcoded rejections. `claim`
and `close` are the two with their own predicates:
- `claim` refuses an unresolved claim-blocker (`ready()` false).
- `close` refuses an unresolved close-blocker (`closeable()` false).
Both read `blockers` against file-existence ("resolved" = closed/dropped = file gone) — the same
`ready()`/`closeable()` predicates core already computes, so enforcement costs a rejection, not a
mechanism.

*Why core, not a plugin (revises the original "gating plugin is the sole enforcer" — bl-70f5):*
balls is unopinionated about workflow, but a primitive must mean what it says: a blocker that does
not block is not a feature. And enforcement must not be severable — forge and build gates create
gate *children* and rely on those children *blocking*, so a separate gating plugin would make
forge/build silently depend on it being installed: an implicit, unverifiable plugin-on-plugin
dependency, and plugins coordinate only through core schema, never by depending on each other's
presence (§0). Gate *resolution* stays fully pluggable (who creates and closes a gate child —
forge/build/human); only the *blocking* is core. A team wanting no enforcement simply creates no
blockers; there is no enforcement to uninstall.

**Front-door flags are CORE** (they write core schema; plugins are hook binaries and do not extend
`bl`'s parser, so there is no plugin-injected-flag composition). Two ORTHOGONAL flags, one for each
fact — containment and blocking never travel together implicitly:
- `--parent E`  → child `parent: E`                          (CONTAINMENT only — gates nothing)
- `--blocks OP` → `E.blockers += {child, OP}` where `E` is the `--parent` (or `--blocks ID:OP` to gate
  an explicit non-parent `ID`) — the new task gates that task's `OP`. The two everyday spellings are
  `--blocks claim` (subtask must finish before the parent can START) and `--blocks close` (gate: must
  finish before the parent can CLOSE). `OP` is required — there is no default-gated transition.
- `--needs B` (or `--needs B:OP`) → `self.blockers += {B, OP}`, default `OP = claim` — the inverse
  direction: the new task is gated BY `B` (cross-tree dependency).

The retired `--gates X` is exactly `--parent X --blocks close`. Any edge the one-liner can't express
(gate a third op, multiple blockers, a post-hoc edge) is an ordinary `bl update … blockers` edit —
the create flags are sugar over the general primitive, never a constraint on it.

**Gates are tasks only** — every gate-check is "is task X closed?". Build/test = a build-gate child a
build plugin creates and closes on pass; forge/PR approval = a child the forge plugin creates and a
forge `sync` closes on merge; human approval = a child a person closes. Creation rides `claim.post`
(the deliverable signal) so non-deliverables stay clutter-free. The resolution mechanism is pluggable;
the blocking mechanism is one thing.

(The old "late-added subtask doesn't gate a claimed epic's close" gap is DISSOLVED, not patched: it
existed only because `--parent` auto-minted a *claim* edge. With containment and blocking separated,
you state the gate you want — `--blocks close` gates close whenever the child is added, claimed epic
or not — and if you state nothing, nothing gates, by design. No skill-hint "don't" required.)

## §11 Delivery / worktree plugin

A SIBLING of tracker (default-wired, separate — so worktrees-without-remote ⊥ remote-without-
worktrees). It owns the deliverable CODE worktree — a `git worktree` of the PROJECT repo on branch
`work/<id>` — end to end. Base balls never opens the project repo, so "nothing on main / nothing in
the project tree" is structural.

**Kind-blind.** The plugin NEVER branches on task kind. It materializes a worktree on `claim.post`,
delivers-if-changes + tears down on `close`, blind to whether the task is an epic, a gate, or real
work. Non-deliverables are normally closed without being claimed → no worktree is ever made; a
claimed non-deliverable gets a harmless EMPTY worktree (the close.pre squash is a no-op when
`work/<id>` has no changes; close.post remove is a no-op when the path is absent). This dissolves any cross-plugin tag coordination — the worktree plugin reads no blocker state at all.

**Derived path; stateless across ops.** The worktree path and branch are pure functions of
`(binding, id)`:
```
worktree_path(binding, id [, claimant]) = $XDG_STATE_HOME/balls/plugins/<name>/<pct-enc(binding.invocation_path)>/<key>/
branch                                   = work/<key>          # <key> = <id>, or <id>-<claimant>
```
`<id>` (and `claimant`, if keyed on) ride the post wire — `<id>` is the immutable `bl-id` trailer,
`claimant` an ordinary frontmatter field — so the plugin RECOMPUTES its resource each op and checks
the filesystem; it needs no id-keyed scratch, and every hook is idempotent by construction. Keying on
`claimant` as well as `id` keeps the pure-function/stateless property (claimant is already on the
wire) while disambiguating a drop-and-reclaim by a different actor and naming forge branches by owner.
**Core never computes this path.** The plugin owns the formula end to end; on `claim.post` it PRINTS
the path on its stdout (§6) and balls forwards that to the invoker — so "claim prints the path" holds
with zero core knowledge of the plugin's territory (no privileged plugin, §0/§6). The worktree lives
in plugin XDG territory, not the project tree.

**Hooks:** `claim.post` materialize (create-if-absent); `unclaim.post`/`drop.post` release
(remove-if-present); **`close.pre` deliver** (sorts last); **`close.post` teardown**. balls does not
guard against tearing a worktree down from inside it — the agent SHOULD `cd` out of the worktree
before closing so its shell cwd is not deleted underneath it (a recommendation in the skill guide,
not an enforced precondition).

**Two variants** (only "what's wired into the delivery hooks" differs; both kind-blind and idempotent):
- DIRECT (default, local-squash): `close.pre` squashes `work/<id>` → integration as one commit
  whose subject carries the `[bl-id]` delivery tag (the plugin's analog of the §5 trailer; this tag
  is delivery ground truth). Integration branch is the delivery plugin's own config (default
  `HEAD@project-repo`); a per-task override, if ever needed, rides as a preserved frontmatter key
  (§3 seam), NEVER a core field — core opens no project repo, so it has no integration branch to name. No gate child.
- FORGE (opt-in): the forge plugin adds an **approval gate child** at `claim.post` (a normal
  close-blocker, §10 — NOT a special mechanism; identical to a build or audit gate), and at `close.pre`
  idempotently pushes `work/<id>` + opens/updates the PR. The forge produces the squash (the merge), so
  `close.pre` does NOT squash locally. A forge `sync` closes the gate child on merge → the next close
  unblocks. Core enforces the block (the close-blocker guard, §10), not a bundle-private check. An empty deliverable's gate is auto-resolved (the plugin closes its own gate
  child at `close.pre` when `work/<id>` has no changes — nothing to review), preserving kind-blindness.

**`delivered_in` is a derived query, not a field** — "delivery IS the tag, not a field." The plugin
answers "where was `<id>` delivered?" by tag-scanning (`git log --grep [bl-id]`) the integration
branch; no stored hint, no write/null asymmetry, no staleness. (A cross-clone miss is reported
honestly or resolved by a tracker fetch.)

**Rollback** (specifics; general rule §14): project-repo commits are tier-2 (`git reset`, not covered
by the change-worktree/store un-seal). `rollback claim.post` = remove the worktree + delete
`work/<id>` (forge: also drop the just-created gate child); `rollback close.pre` direct = `git reset
--hard HEAD~1` un-squash (reversible — nothing pushed); forge = **no-op** — a pushed branch + open PR
is the correct in-review state, never undone (abandon is `bl drop`, whose `drop.post` tears down the
PR/branch). `close.post` teardown removes the worktree DIRECTORY (re-creatable from the branch, so it
is rollback-safe); deleting `work/<id>` is deferred, non-transactional cleanup (`prime`).
The only irreversible action in a close is therefore the tracker's final push, which sorts LAST.

## §12 bl prime & federation (the store pointer)

`prime` is the **idempotent** verb that brings a checkout into readiness — "make me ready to start
the engine." It absorbs the old `init`: founding is not a separate verb, it is `prime`'s
**bootstrap-on-miss** path. Run it on a fresh dir and it founds; run it on an established checkout and
every step is create-if-absent → no-op-converge. **Converging predicate:** the landing
(`balls/config`) exists and the store (`tasks_branch`) resolves to a valid, current `tasks/` checkout,
whether the path was empty, fresh-cloned, freshly-onboarded, or already established — base balls
cannot tell which ran, so re-running prime is never an error (no `--reinit`).

Core only (a) ensures the landing + store substrate and (b) runs the configured plugin chain, then
commits — it has zero knowledge of tracker/remotes/stealth. **The local-miss branch SEEDS a fresh
landing by copying the app-level `default-config/` folder (§1) into `balls/config`** (`git init` if no
repo; the `tasks_branch` branch with an empty `tasks/`; one commit each). The seed is where the
tracker + delivery + builtin plugin wiring comes from — so `prime`'s `prime/pre`/`prime/post` run the
plugins NOW IN THE LANDING LIST (there are no run-time defaults, §0/§4); on an established landing the
seed step is a no-op (config already present). Per-session worktree re-materialization for still-claimed
tasks rides the same chain (the delivery plugin's `prime.post`, idempotent create-if-absent, §11).

**Tracker's prime** (the wire handler under the sync loop): `--stealth` → the store stays local, no
remote; else resolve a remote (`--remote` > `--center` > XDG > `origin`) for `tasks_branch` and `sync`
it — present → fast-forward/adopt; **absent → bootstrap (create+push)**. Remote founding is therefore
**gated by having the tracker at all**: the opt-out is structural — drop the tracker or `--stealth`
and prime never touches a remote (the seeded tracker *is* the consent to leave a branch on `origin`).
Adopting an established store branch and founding an absent one are the same `sync`-or-bootstrap step,
the difference read from remote state, not a flag. **Implicit founding is fine:** creating a `balls`
branch on a repo you can push to is harmless and once-per-clone — `--stealth` opts out (and locks the
store local). A push that fails for lack of perms falls back to stealth-local silently, so the
"harmless by definition" property holds even without write access.

**Federation = many landings, ONE store branch.** There is no trail, no terminus, no transitive
discovery, no `operating/` symlink (all retired with config-shadowing — §4). A center is not a special
branch: it is just whatever `tasks_branch` a set of checkouts have agreed to share, backed by a common
remote. Federating is two edits, both consented:
- **`tasks_branch` names the store** (a §4 config field on the landing). Point it at a shared,
  remote-backed branch and your checkout reads/writes that store; point it local and you are stealth.
  Changing it is an ordinary config edit — and config changes only by you or by `install` (§6), never
  silently.
- **`bl install --from <center>` adopts the center's config + plugins**, with consent — how a checkout
  learns a non-default `tasks_branch` and gains the team's tooling. **The STANDARD case needs no
  install:** the seeded defaults name `origin` + `balls/tasks`, so a fresh clone of a repo whose store
  sits there runs `bl prime; bl list` out of the box — prime adopts the existing store (a read), no
  config adopted. **Anything non-standard needs install** — a center's config, a non-default branch, a
  third-party plugin — because adopting config is potential RCE and crosses only by the explicit
  `install` (§0/§4). `prime` is auto-safe (it seeds the LOCAL default and syncs what landing already
  names); it CANNOT adopt a foreign config or activate third-party code — that power lives only in the
  deliberate `install` (and `prime --install`, §13).

**Non-default store, no install → a WARNING, not silence.** The one ergonomic gap: clone a repo whose
store is on a NON-default branch and `bl prime; bl list` shows nothing (the seeded default points
elsewhere). prime fetches the standard `origin:balls/config` regardless (reading is free), so the
tracker has it in hand — and if the landing's `tasks_branch` is still the SEEDED DEFAULT (not user-set,
not `--stealth`) AND the synced `origin:balls/config` names a different store, the tracker EMITS A
WARNING ("this repo's tasks are on `<branch>` — run `bl install` / `bl prime --install`"). Diagnostic,
never authority — it changes nothing and executes nothing (§0). A non-standard branch with no
`origin:balls/config` to read is uncatchable — so be it.

**"Center" is emergent.** No branch declares itself a center; a center is just a store branch that ≥1
landings' `tasks_branch` values converge on (in-degree). Setting up a center = point your
`tasks_branch` at the shared branch and `install` it to the checkouts that should join. Founding
(remote store branch absent → create+push) vs joining (present → adopt) is read from remote state,
never declared by a flag.

**Re-homing — stealth ↔ federated (bl-0601, revised).** There is **no `adopt`/`disown`/`remaster`
verb**. "Stealth vs federated" is just whether `tasks_branch` is local or remote-backed, and re-homing
is the two directions of one invariant — *the store moves to its new home BEFORE its name changes* —
decomposed onto two scopes of two verbs that already own the halves:
- **The name is config's.** Repoint `tasks_branch` (a §4 config edit on the landing); the tracker
  syncs the new branch on the next `prime`/`sync` (established-vs-fresh stays the read-from-remote
  sync-or-bootstrap fork above, never a flag).
- **The store is `install`'s.** Merge the store into its new home with `bl install tasks/* --from <old>
  --to <new>` (glob = union, §6) when the home is populated, or `bl install tasks` (folder = mirror)
  into an empty home. `tasks/` is a committed subtree, so this is just install's path-copy. Disown
  (federated→stealth) is the reverse: pull the store down to a local branch, then repoint `tasks_branch`
  local.
Order is non-destructive by construction: the store moves to its new home BEFORE the pointer changes;
the glob union is additive (a same-`id` overwrites, git-recoverable, §6). Config and store are just
different *paths* of one path-copy verb. No new verb, no new dispatcher surface, no `bl tracker`.

**Config never auto-layers (bl-62bc revised — see §4).** The old "config VALUES layer automatically
down the trail" is RETIRED: there is no trail, and a center's config reaches you only by explicit
`bl install` (§6), materialized into your landing once, with consent. Executable plugins were already
install-only/consented; now config VALUES are too — one uniform rule, *nothing crosses a checkout
boundary except by `install` (config) or `sync` (the store)*, replacing the old asymmetry where
values silently shadowed but executables didn't. A center is the source of truth for the RECOMMENDED
config + plugin set; the committed `plugins.toml` schedule travels on install, the local `bin/<name>`
never does, so a center can never make your box run a binary you didn't opt into.

**Sync is two-tier (bl-62bc revised; verb mechanics → §13).**
- **The store** (`tasks_branch`) syncs **every op, default ON** — you push mutations (claim/close) to
  the remote store branch, so each op runs against an up-to-date store (pull → mutate → push). A
  tracked store that isn't current is a surprise; an offline knob exists but the default is synced.
- **Config never syncs.** It is landing-local and changes only by `install` (consent, §6). `sync`
  moves the store ONLY — it structurally cannot re-home your config or activate code. There is no
  topology to refresh beyond the `tasks_branch` value itself, which is config.
- This generalizes: per-op sync is just what a stateful plugin's `sync` does (tracker syncs the store;
  a jira plugin syncs issue state). Not tracker-special — the synchronization contract.

SEAM: core reads config from the landing and reads/writes tasks on `tasks_branch` (knows nothing of
remotes — stealth = a local `tasks_branch`, identical code); the tracker translates remote↔local for
the STORE branch only (fetches the configured remote into the §1 layout, keeps the store synced). The
physical realization is §1 (`config/` and `tasks/` are two checkouts; the store checkout tracks
`plugins/tracker/<remote>/` when remote-backed, a local branch in stealth — no `operating/` symlink);
`bl sync`/`prime` verb mechanics + contention are §13.

Error/notice catalog (verbatim, ownership in brackets): E1 [tracker] no store remote resolved
(stealth/no-tracker is fine — this fires only when a remote was named but unresolvable); E4 [tracker]
remote unreachable (refusing to bootstrap); E7 [balls] plugin failed during prime, rolled back K
prior; W1 [tracker] store is stealth (local), not auto-syncing. (Retired by idempotent prime: E2
"already initialized" — re-running prime is a no-op-converge; E3 "remote already established" —
established vs absent is the adopt-vs-bootstrap fork, not an error. Retired by the trail's removal: N3
downstream-layer-introduces-plugins — there is no downstream layer.)

## § id generation

The id scheme is FIXED — `bl-` + 4 lowercase-hex digits (`{ prefix, length, alphabet }` =
`{ "bl-", 4, "0123456789abcdef" }`), no generator enum and NOT a config knob. Base balls ships ONE
generator (random) over that one scheme; ANY customization — a different prefix/length/alphabet, OR a
non-random strategy (timestamp/sequential/uuid) — is a `create/pre` plugin via the same `git mv`
reassign seam, so "custom generation" and "plugin-assigned id" are one seam. **Validation is
string-safety**, not an arbitrary charset: `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$` (no `/`, no `.`, no
whitespace/metacharacters, no leading `-`). The default alphabet is lowercase to sidestep
case-insensitive-FS collisions. **Collision:** auto-gen → retry (bounded); plugin-assigned → abort
(an explicit choice is authoritative). id is IMMUTABLE after create; reassignment is a create-only
capability, so during claim/close it rides the wire with no skew.

## §13 bl sync & bl prime

`sync` and `prime` are ordinary ops (§8) — each with `sync.pre|post` and `prime.pre|post` hook keys,
every listed plugin invoked in list order, failure → reverse-order rollback. They author NO
ball-file diff, so there is **no change worktree** — plugins run with cwd = the store checkout
(`tasks/`) and act on the filesystem there (§7), never through a return channel. Core commits nothing
of its own; the only state that moves is remote-authored commits a plugin imports, or external/derived
caches it refreshes.

**`bl sync` — the synchronization primitive.** Low-level, run often: it makes state consistent and is
mostly a verb for plugins to hook. `bl sync` (no arg) syncs the **store** — fast-forwards/unions
`tasks_branch` with its configured remote; `bl sync <branch>` syncs a named branch. It moves **task
state only**: config is landing-local and changes only by `install` (§6), so sync *structurally
cannot* re-home your config or activate code — it touches the store branch and nothing else. The store
branch may be a shared one the whole team names (`tasks_branch`); syncing it is ordinary federation,
not a consent breach, because consent governs config + executable plugins, never store currency.

- **`--branch` names a sync TARGET, and the landing is never one.** `bl sync --branch landing` is a
  no-op — *for free*, not by special-case. The landing is the local, path-derived config branch (§2):
  it is single-owner, has no upstream to fetch, and holds no task state to move (tasks live on
  `tasks_branch`). The general rule "fetch a branch's upstream, if any" yields nothing on an
  upstream-less branch, and the landing is upstream-less by construction (§4 — it is never a sync
  target). The landing changes only by `install`, never by sync.
- **No separate contention probe.** The tracker's hook is a single `git fetch` + **fast-forward-only**
  integration; that one operation is atomically detect-and-act — a non-ff IS the contention signal,
  surfaced as the tracker's non-zero exit ("remote wins, re-run"). A distinct `sync/pre` "has the
  remote moved?" check is rejected: it adds a round-trip and a TOCTOU window and duplicates what
  ff-only already decides in one step (contention is the ff-failure path, not a phase of its own).
- **Where the integration sits.** With no core commit, sync's pre/post boundary IS the tracker's
  fetch+ff: the tracker is wired into **`sync/pre`** so it imports remote store state first;
  **`sync/post`** plugins (cache rebuild, worktree re-materialize) react to the now-current store. A
  non-ff aborts in pre and never reaches post. This is the one op whose boundary action belongs to a
  plugin, not core — because remote-talk is plugin-exclusive (§0).

**`bl prime` — readiness, built FROM sync.** prime is not a hook-superset of sync; it is an
**orchestrator of syncs** (§12): ensure the landing + store substrate, `bl sync` the store, and
bootstrap it if it has nothing to sync from. "Ready to start the engine" = substrate exists + store
synced + claimed-task worktrees re-materialized (delivery's `prime.post`, §11). Idempotent: on an
established checkout every step is create-if-absent/already-current, so re-running converges to a
no-op. The whole verb is the §12 converging predicate.

- **prime drives sync; it does not duplicate it.** Keeping the fetch inside the sync primitive is what
  makes "all wire transfer goes through sync" a true single-codepath invariant. prime's only distinct
  work is substrate + consent-free local readiness + materialization; currency it gets by *invoking
  sync*, not by reimplementing a fetch. On an already-joined checkout prime is exactly the sync you'd
  run by hand plus the idempotent worktree pass — nothing more.
- **prime ≠ install, but `prime --install` fuses them on demand.** Plain `prime` is auto-safe and runs
  every session: it seeds the local default (§12), syncs what landing already names, and NEVER adopts
  foreign config or activates third-party code. Adopting is the deliberate `install` (§6).
  **`prime --install <center>`** is the one-command first-contact / re-adopt: prime ensures the local
  substrate, `install` copies the center's config + plugin wiring into the landing (§6, consent-gated),
  and a final prime brings the just-adopted `tasks_branch` to readiness. It is a SINGLE hop, not a
  walk: a center's config is self-contained — it names its own `tasks_branch` (the one config→store
  indirection, §4), never another config to chase — so there is no chain to recurse. (The older
  recursive multi-hop form was a config-*trail* artifact, retired with config-shadowing: §4/§12 —
  config crosses a checkout boundary exactly ONCE, by explicit install.) Each install is idempotent,
  so a failed adopt resumes rather than double-applies. The `--install` flag IS the consent — plain
  prime still cannot activate code, so the auto-safe property holds for the every-session path.
  Likewise prime never *pushes* config; outbound transfer is `install --to` (§6).

**The wire (§6/§7), minus the task-shaped fields.** A sync/prime plugin gets meaning from its
`binding`, not from a command:

- **argv:** `<op> <phase>` (`sync|prime` / `pre|post`). **env:** `BALLS_PROTOCOL=1`,
  `BALLS_PLUGIN_NAME`, `BALLS_PLUGIN_DEPTH` (the §6 set). **cwd:** the store checkout (`tasks/`).
- **pre stdin:** `{ protocol, op, phase, plugin_name, actor, binding }`. `binding =
  { remote, tasks_branch, store, landing, invocation_path }` is the load-bearing payload — exactly
  what a fetcher needs (`remote` + `tasks_branch` + the `store` checkout path). **Absent:** `command`
  (nothing is authored — no `field_changes`/`body_change`) and `current_state`/`previous_state`
  (sync/prime are not per-task transitions).
- **post stdin:** the same plus `previous_commit`/`commit` — the store branch HEAD before and
  after the op, bracketing what was integrated. `previous_commit` is the one datum a plugin cannot
  recover afterward (the old ref is gone once ff'd), so it rides the wire; `null` on a fresh-clone
  prime where nothing pre-existed. **Still absent:** `metadata` — sync/prime write no balls commit,
  so there is no §5 trailer block to parse. A plugin curious about an arrived commit's trailers reads
  them from the store via git itself (the §7 filesystem-not-return-channel rule); the "trailer
  metadata of the triggering op" framing does not apply — these are top-level ops, not triggered by a
  trailer-bearing op.

**Rollback.** The same reverse-order discipline as any op, but with no change worktree to discard
rollback reduces to each plugin's own `rollback` hook. Most sync/prime plugins are idempotent
refreshers (rollback is a no-op); the tracker's ff is a local ref move with nothing pushed, so a
partial sync leaves the store at either the old or the new HEAD, never wedged — re-running sync
converges (§14).

## §14 Rollback — the general rule

Rollback is the unwind half of §8: any non-zero `pre`/`post` exit aborts the op, calls `rollback` on
each already-run plugin in REVERSE execution order, then core UN-SEALS its own change. One rule
governs everything: **every run plugin's rollback is invoked in reverse; the plugin decides what
"undo" means; core un-seals.** §11 is the worked DERIVED-state example, §13 the no-change-worktree
(sync/prime) case.

**Three side-effect tiers — WHERE it landed decides WHO unwinds it.**
1. **The ball record** — the staged file edits AND core's seal (commit + integrate to the target
   branch: the store for task ops, the landing for config ops). Core un-seals: a PRE-phase abort
   discards the un-sealed change worktree (nothing reached the branch); a POST-phase abort `git reset`s
   the target branch back one commit (local and reversible — core never pushes, so there is nothing
   remote to chase). **No plugin rollback needed for tier 1.**
2. **Commits/refs on ANOTHER local git repo** (the delivery plugin's squash onto the project
   integration branch, its `work/<id>` branch). The un-seal never touches a second repo. **The
   plugin's `rollback` does the `git reset` / branch delete** — locally reversible because nothing
   was pushed.
3. **External side effects** (the tracker pushed the balls branch, jira created a ticket). Not even
   local. **The plugin's `rollback` is best-effort** and may be irreversible.

One plugin can span tiers (delivery: a tier-2 squash plus tier-1 worktree-discardable files).

**Rollback spans the seal boundary — the OP is the unit of atomicity, not the phase.** When any
plugin fails — INCLUDING a `post` reactor after the seal — every plugin that already ran a phase for
THIS op is rolled back, in strict reverse order, regardless of which phase it ran. A plugin wired
into `<op>/pre` but NOT `<op>/post` DOES get a `rollback` call when a later `post` plugin fails: its
pre side-effect is part of the op, and the op didn't happen. The `rolling_back: pre|post` field (§7)
tells the plugin which of ITS OWN phases is unwinding.

**Persistence-through-abort is the plugin's own rollback choosing a no-op — never a core carve-out.**
Core always calls rollback on every prior plugin; whether a side-effect survives the abort is decided
by that plugin's rollback, by the side-effect's semantics:
- the forge plugin's `close.pre` rollback is a **no-op** — a pushed branch + open PR is the correct
  "in review" state, never something to undo (abandon is `bl drop`);
- the jira plugin's `create.pre` rollback **deletes** the issue — an orphan ticket for a ball that
  never sealed is wrong.

So an effect persists through a stop IFF the plugin that made it declines to undo it; you can never
accidentally strand another plugin's effect. This dissolves any need for a special "deferred" or
"blocked-close keeps its setup" mode: a blocked forge close is just core rejecting on the claim-time approval gate (`closeable()` false, §10/§11), and the push/PR persist because their rollback no-ops. Two stop
shapes, one rule:
- **blocked** (any gate open: dependency / approval / build / audit) — core rejects before the seal; priors roll back; idempotent delivery effects survive via no-op rollbacks.
- **failed** (jira down, squash conflict, push fails) — priors roll back; each undoes its own (jira
  deletes the issue, the squash `git reset`s).

**Best-effort, no retry, exit code IGNORED.** Core invokes each `rollback` once and CONTINUES
unwinding whatever it exits — it never retries and cannot verify success. If a stubborn plugin's exit
could abort the unwind, one plugin would strand every earlier-run plugin; continue-regardless is the
only composition that fully unwinds. Core's tier-1 un-seal always succeeds (local), so the op's core
invariant holds even if every plugin rollback fails. A FAILING plugin's own rollback is not called —
it cleans up inline before exiting non-zero. Plugins log load-bearing detail to stderr, which balls
envelopes into the unified `clones/<enc>/log` (§6). Rollback MUST be idempotent — safe when the side-effect was never made
or already undone; the derive-and-check pattern below gives this for free.

**post never mutates the ball; derive-don't-store is what makes that safe.** The ball is sealed at the
boundary, so a `post` reactor cannot edit it (that would need a second commit). Anything that must
live on the ball is written in `pre`; a value that only EXISTS post-seal (the integration sha) is
DERIVED on read (§11 `delivered_in` is a `git log --grep` query, never a written-back field), so no
reactor ever needs a return channel. This is why two hooks suffice and post stays purely outward-facing.

**State for rollback: DERIVE first, scratch only when you must.**
- **DERIVE (preferred).** If the resource is a pure function of `(binding, id)` plus the git/
  filesystem state the plugin already owns, store NOTHING: recompute and inspect/undo (remove-if-present;
  `git reset` if HEAD carries the `[bl-id]` tag). §11's delivery plugin — `worktree_path(binding, id)`
  recomputed every op — is the worked example; every hook is idempotent by construction. "Don't store
  what you can compute," applied to rollback.
- **SCRATCH (only for non-derivable state).** A plugin whose intermediate state genuinely cannot be
  recomputed — an id an external service ASSIGNED, a prior value about to be overwritten — persists it
  in its own §1 territory, id-keyed: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/balls/plugins/<name>/<id>/` (prepend
  `pct-enc(invocation_path)` when the resource is per-checkout, as §11 does). **Env vars cannot serve
  this** — `BALLS_*` is balls→plugin for ONE invocation; it never crosses from a plugin's `pre`
  process to its later `post`/`rollback` process. The filesystem territory does, and it is already the
  plugin's by §1.
- **The id is the one key, and it serves cross-op too.** `bl-id` rides every per-task wire (pre reads
  it from the single staged `tasks/*.md`; post/rollback from the sealed §5 trailer), so ONE convention
  — id-keyed scratch — serves BOTH same-op `pre→post` handoff AND cross-op persistence (`claim.post`
  writes, `close.post`/rollback reads). Scratch lifetime is bounded by the resource: the plugin deletes
  `<name>/<id>/` when the resource is gone (successful terminal op, or after a rollback consumes it) —
  no archive (mirrors §2). Rollback is scoped to ONE op invocation — it never reaches back to undo a
  prior op that already SUCCEEDED, so a rolled-back op leaves prior-op scratch intact for a retry.

**Un-undoable side-effects sort LAST.** A plugin with a tier-3 (or otherwise irreversible) side-effect
is placed LAST in its phase's hook list, so nothing runs after it — making its rollback the RARE
path (rollback fires only when a LATER plugin fails). A CONTRACT RECOMMENDATION, not enforced (core
reads no plugin semantics, §0). In a close the only irreversible action is the tracker's final push,
so it sorts last; delivery `close.post` teardown removes the worktree DIRECTORY (re-creatable from the
branch, hence rollback-safe) while `work/<id>` deletion is deferred, non-transactional cleanup.

**Reference plugin — the scratch handoff** (the non-derivable counterpart to §11's derived example): a
plugin mirroring the ball to an external tracker that assigns its OWN id.
- `create.pre`: create the remote issue; write the returned id into the staged frontmatter (so the
  seal captures it) AND to `plugins/<name>/<bl-id>/id` (scratch covers the window before the
  frontmatter write — the one genuinely non-derivable gap).
- `close.post`: read the id from the sealed trailer (derivable — no scratch needed here), transition
  the remote issue, then delete the scratch dir.
- `rollback create.pre`: read the id from scratch/worktree, best-effort delete the remote issue,
  remove the scratch dir. Idempotent: absent ⇒ nothing created ⇒ no-op.

**sync/prime have no change worktree** (§13): tier 1 is empty (no ball seal), so rollback reduces to
each plugin's own `rollback`. Most sync/prime plugins are idempotent refreshers (no-op rollback); the
tracker's ff is a local ref move with nothing pushed, so a partial sync leaves the store at the old
or the new HEAD, never wedged — re-running converges.

## §15 Open topics (epic bl-b465)

Each becomes a § edit here when settled. **None open** — every topic resolved into the body.

RESOLVED (folded into the body, no longer open):
- **recursion guard → general invocation-tree cap, fail+rollback (2026-06-07, bl-7110 — post-freeze).**
  §6 read: at the `BALLS_PLUGIN_DEPTH` cap "nested ops run PLUGIN-FREE (suppressed, not refused)" and "a
  plugin may deliberately re-enable plugins on a nested call." Two defects. (1) What the guard catches is
  almost always a BUG — self-retrigger, a plugin wired on op X whose handler shells `bl X` (a `sync.post`
  plugin running `bl sync`), climbing depth to the cap; the legit shell-back (forge `claim.post` →
  `bl create` for the gate child) goes 1 deep and never re-triggers its own op, so it never nears the
  cap. Running PLUGIN-FREE at the cap converts that runaway into QUIET wrong-behavior: the offending
  plugin gets no signal and the op silently runs without the plugins it expected — the worst disposition.
  (2) The re-enable hatch lets a runaway defeat its own backstop. RESOLVED, two moves: disposition FLIP
  (suppress → fail+rollback) and GENERALIZE. Cap-hit now ABORTS + rolls back (§8/§14 reverse-order) with a
  diagnostic naming the op/plugin chain, so the loop surfaces. And the cap is no longer plugin-specific:
  it is ONE odometer over the whole INVOCATION TREE — every nested `bl` bumps it whatever the source
  (plugin shell-back, op→op, clone→clone), so plugin-recursion-depth is just one DIMENSION and the same
  backstop also catches runaway clone-spawning. The hatch is DELETED; a one-line note discourages a
  plugin from re-triggering its own op (the §0 "plugins don't depend on each other's presence" already
  covers the mutual `plugin1`↔`plugin2` half). Bounded chains are unaffected (they never hit the cap);
  finer-grained per-op controls can layer on top — this is the failback under them. Touched §6 (rewrote
  the guard bullet). No code follow-up filed; enforcement lives in core dispatch/run alongside the
  existing depth env.
- **`status` plugin SUBTRACTED — bedrock vs render projection (2026-06-07, bl-d074 — post-freeze).** The
  topic proposed a shipped default `status` plugin that persists a 4-value field (`open`/`blocked`/
  `in_progress`/`in_review`) and keeps it fresh by **cross-task fan-out** (`close.post`/`drop.post`
  re-sealing every claim-blocker dependent — the system's first write-amplification), to spare external
  integrators reimplementing core's derived ladder (§3) when they read `--json`/raw files. RESOLVED by
  SUBTRACTION: the real gap was a *use-case conflation*, not a missing denormalization. `--json` exists
  to expose **bedrock** — the lossless, round-trippable mirror of stored state ("what's actually
  there") — so injecting a derived `status` into it defeats its one job. The two needs are two
  orthogonal PROJECTIONS the verbs already embody: the DEFAULT human render (`bl show`/`list`/`ready`)
  paints derived columns (the status ladder, tree, ISO dates); `--json` stays bedrock. A machine
  integrator reads bedrock `--json` (`claimant` + `blockers`, already present) and runs the same ~6-line
  ladder core runs — so no stored field, no fan-out, no drift, no backfill, no plugin. The only residue
  (the gate/PR `in_review` 4th value core folds into "claimed", §3, and a *stored ordered pipeline*)
  stays the §3 opt-in seam — a preserved `state:` key + a team's own display plugin, severable, never
  default. The denormalization-cache (which the ball itself admitted "a WRONG cache is worse than none")
  is gone; SSOT (the derived ladder, §3) holds. Touched §3/§9 (named the bedrock-vs-render split
  explicitly). No code follow-up — the subtraction removes a build (it was gated on bl-20fc/bl-4e14).
- **plugin schedule is config, not the filesystem (2026-06-07, bl-8540 — post-freeze).** FLIPS the §4
  line "There is likewise no `plugins` config list — the filesystem symlink registry (§6) IS the plugin
  chain" 180°. The trigger: the symlink registry (`config/plugins/<op>/<phase>/NN-<name>` →
  `../bin/<name>`) was a SECOND config mechanism running parallel to §4's `balls.toml` layering, and it
  had reinvented an ordered list badly — run order encoded as a `NN-` string-prefix on filenames, the
  sysvinit/`/etc/rc.d` tic. But §4 ALREADY has ordered lists with merge directives (`compose_list` /
  `_prepend`/`_append`/`_ban`, built + tested in `config.rs`). RESOLUTION by SUBTRACTION:
  (1) the HOOK SCHEDULE moves into a committed, §4-layered `config/plugins.toml` — a `[hooks]` table
  mapping `<op>.<phase>` → an ORDERED LIST of plugin names; **list position = run order** (the last
  name runs last, so the §8/§14 "irreversible push sorts LAST" is just "tracker is last in the list").
  An absent/empty list = run nothing. It layers + merges exactly like every other config field, so a
  center's schedule composes with an XDG `_prepend`/`_append`/`_ban` and travels by `bl install` — ONE
  layering mechanism, not two.
  (2) the BIN folder is UNCHANGED — `config/plugins/bin/<name>` machine-local gitignored symlinks;
  install drops a symlink, dispatch resolves a hooked NAME to it, a dangling `bin/<name>` is the same
  clean "referenced but not installed here" error. Schedule (committed text) and binary (local symlink)
  now split on file-vs-symlink instead of two symlink levels.
  (3) `install`'s plugin-wiring-mirror collapses — `install plugins.toml` is an ordinary config copy;
  no symlink-tree walk, no `Object::Plugins` special path beyond binding+protocol-validating the named
  binaries. WHAT WE LOSE (accepted): sparse mid-phase insertion. `NN-` was a sparse integer keyspace
  (slot in at `70` between `50` and `90`); a positional list with `_prepend`/`_append` only lands at an
  END of a phase — mid-insertion needs a full-list replacement. The one HARD constraint (tracker's push
  LAST) holds because `_prepend` covers "run before the push." No load-bearing principle breaks: §0
  "core knows a plugin's name + binary, never its config" holds (the schedule is CORE's config, not the
  plugin's); §6 "sequence of binaries, run-parts" becomes "sequence of binaries, list-ordered" — same
  semantics. Touched §0/§2/§4/§6/§8/§9/§12/§13/§14/§16. Implementation: registry→config conversion in
  `registry.rs`/`install.rs`/`config.rs`/`substrate.rs`/`mutate.rs`/`checkout.rs` + delivery wiring,
  and bl-4e14's seed collapses to a plain-text `plugins.toml` (`include_str!`, no `build.rs`/symlink
  embedding). Tracked under bl-72a8.
- **observability — logs & metrics (2026-06-06, bl-b58a — post-freeze).** A topic raised AFTER the
  freeze (so the "None open" above had missed it): the doc carried three divergent log conventions —
  §1 `logs/<name>/plugin.log` "suggested; plugins do as they please", §6 "stderr captured to
  clones/<enc>/logs/<name>/", and §14's rollback echo — while the code (bl-5d56) had invented a fourth,
  per-op-phase `logs/<name>/<op>-<phase>.log`. RESOLUTION by reframe + subtraction:
  (1) ONE unified per-clone log `clones/<enc>/log` (§1) — JSON-lines, balls-owned, the source a stamped
  FIELD not a directory split, so you grep one source or read the whole sequence. Core emits its own
  lifecycle records AND envelopes each plugin stderr line; the plugin stays dumb (no `BALLS_LOG_DIR`).
  (2) `log_level` (§4) is the single write-time threshold over both file and terminal; a non-zero
  plugin exit emits a core `error` record that survives any threshold (§6).
  (3) METRICS CUT from core entirely (§6) — the log is the event stream and §5 trailers the history;
  metrics are a query or a `*.post` plugin, never core storage, no new seam. Touched §1/§4/§6/§14.
  Code reconciliation (replace bl-5d56's per-op-phase capture; delete dead `layout::log()`) is bl-2e9f.
- **doctor SUBTRACTED (2026-06-06, bl-77a7 — post-freeze).** The old §16 was `bl doctor`, a read-op
  drift-scanner (resolved earlier under bl-e8a5). Cut ENTIRELY — verb and section. The test it failed:
  given an agent holding the skill doc and a doctor-covered scenario, doctor's existence does not
  meaningfully raise fix-success. 5 of its 8 checks (stale change worktree, unresolved `tasks_branch`,
  unparseable config, missing claimed-ball worktree, stale store) fail LOUD already — git or the next
  op surfaces them, and an agent's reflex is `git status`/`ls`, not a tool-specific scan verb. The 3
  SILENT checks move to POINT-OF-USE errors that name the fix verb: protocol drift is already rejected
  at install (§6, the binary's `protocol` self-describe is validated before binding); a missing local
  `bin/<name>` fails at the op that needs the plugin ("bin/<name> missing — run `bl install`"); a
  blocker cycle is inert — readiness is immediate-only, so it never drives a recursive walk, just a
  mutual permanent-block that `claim` refuses by naming the blocker, `bl update` unlinks (§10). A
  fixed checklist enumerates only KNOWN drift, so doctor helped least on the weird unenumerated cases
  agents actually get stuck on — and an agent only reaches for it once already debugging, when it is
  already exploring git+files. The no-repair-verb principle (every fix is an existing idempotent verb —
  `prime`/`install`/`sync`/`update`) survives without a doctor section; §16 migration's tail now routes
  residual drift to point-of-use. Touched §1/§8/§9/§10/§11; deleted old §16 and scrubbed its
  cross-refs, renumbered §17 migration→§16. Code removal is bl-a38e.
- **coherence pass (2026-06-06, bl-7d46 — post-freeze).** An adversarial read of the just-frozen doc
  (bl-cac0) fixed defects the config/store split and the original drafting left behind:
  (1) §13 `prime --install` still described the RETIRED config CHAIN ("recursively down the config
  chain … until no further redirect"). Collapsed to a SINGLE-hop install (prime → install → prime): a
  center's config is self-contained and config crosses a boundary exactly once (§4/§12).
  (2) "Landing config is the SOLE authority" (§0/§4) overstated — the effective config is the LOCAL
  stack landing ⊕ XDG ⊕ CLI (§4 read order); reworded to "no REMOTE is authoritative."
  (3) §11 PRIVILEGED the delivery plugin: core computed+printed its worktree path, baking the plugin's
  name + territory layout into core (vs §0/§6 "no privileged plugins; core knows only name+binary").
  Fixed by de-privileging — the plugin PRINTS its own path on its stdout, which §6 now defines as the
  plugin's user-facing channel that balls forwards verbatim and parses nothing from; "claim prints the
  path" is the plugin printing, not core knowing. The derived path may also key on `claimant` (already
  on the wire — keeps the stateless-recompute property; disambiguates a reclaim by a new actor).
  (4) §8 "every op is the same shape" was oversold. Reframed to TWO families: task ops (the symmetric
  sealing shape) vs the rest, which inherit partially — `config`/`install` seal to the landing; `sync`/
  `prime` author no diff, inherit only the pre→post spine + rollback, and `sync`'s integration
  is the tracker's ff (a plugin's, not core's).
  (5) Soft spots made structural where cheap: landing single-owner is now "balls cannot publish it"
  (only the tracker pushes, only `tasks_branch`; raw `git push` by hand is the only residue, §4);
  `install`'s folder=wipe blast radius is mitigated by an `N added/M deleted` summary + git-recoverable
  commit, not a flag (§6); §14 sort-last left as-is (the `NN-` prefix is already the structural lever).
  (6) §3/§10 blocker model — generalized + de-conflated (the late-subtask "gap" was a mis-frame, not a
  missing invariant). `on` is now ANY op (claim/close sugared, §3), and **containment is fully separate
  from blocking**: `--parent` sets the tree pointer ONLY and gates nothing; blocking is always explicit
  via `--blocks OP` (gate the parent's — or `ID:OP`'s — op) or `--needs ID[:OP]` (gated-by, default
  claim). `--gates` retires into `--parent X --blocks close`; an epic is pure containment that gates
  nothing by itself; closing a task with live children is allowed (their `parent:` dangles, display-
  only). The standard subtask/gate/review patterns are skill-doc hints, never core rules. This was the
  load-bearing subtraction — every edge is explicit and self-describing, and the deadlock-reciprocal
  and late-add gaps both dissolve because nothing is auto-minted. Touched §3/§9/§10/§16. bl-7d46 fully
  resolved.
- **config/store split (2026-06-05, post-finalization revision — supersedes parts of bl-62bc and
  bl-0601).** The trigger: config-shadowing (§4 values layering down the trail) and `install` were two
  mechanisms for one job — propagating a center's config — and they CONTRADICTED on the threat model.
  install exists to gate config adoption with consent; shadowing adopted it automatically at read,
  leaking around install. The "config is inert data, not code" defense was too weak (a shadowed
  `branch`/`tasks_branch` redirects where you write). RESOLUTION by SUBTRACTION + a reframe:
  (1) kill trail config-layering — config is read only from the landing (+ XDG + defaults, both
  local-trusted); a center's config crosses only by explicit `install`, materialized once (§4).
  (2) SPLIT config and tasks onto two branches (`balls/config` + `balls/tasks`), `config/`/`tasks/`
  top-level folders always — this makes the transport asymmetry STRUCTURAL (config = single-owner,
  destructive install-replace; store = shared, sync-merge) instead of disciplinary, and DISSOLVES the
  whole trail/terminus/`operating`/stealth-mode apparatus: config NAMES the store via `tasks_branch`,
  one indirection that subsumes find-store + sync-target + install-source. Chains
  and transitive auto-discovery go (a layering artifact; one shared store needs no transitivity).
  "Stealth" becomes a `tasks_branch` value, not a mode. (3) `install` is **pure path-copy** —
  `install <path>` makes dest/`<path>` == source/`<path>`, siblings untouched; folder = mirror
  (deletions propagate), file/glob = union (overwrite, no conflict-detect, git recovers). No object
  enum, no merge-vs-replace logic; per-task install falls out free. The store-deletion-resurrection
  worry dissolves by ADDRESSING (use the folder form), not a tombstone mechanism. (4) **landing config
  is the SOLE authority** for what runs + where it syncs, changed only by user command; **ALL config is
  potential RCE** and crosses only by `install` — no "safe data auto-flows" carve-out. (5) **No
  run-time defaults:** a fresh landing is SEEDED at prime by copying the app `default-config/` folder
  (§1), so tracker/delivery/builtin plugins are ordinary landing entries — swap the folder to swap the
  default set (policy in config, not core code). (6) standard case (seeded default `origin` +
  `balls/tasks`) works `prime; list` out of the box; non-default needs `install` (or recursive
  `prime --install`, stop-on-revisit); a tracker WARNING (not silence) fires when landing is on the
  seeded default but `origin:balls/config` names another store. (7) implicit founding is fine (bare
  prime create+push; `--stealth` opts out; no-perms → stealth fallback). Footprint cost = +1 (cheap,
  local) ref; mechanism deleted >> ref added. Reuse of one branch for both roles is legal
  (folder-namespaced) but a config ref shared AS config between clones corrupts (no merge) — so the
  landing is single-owner-by-discipline (§4). Touched §0/§1/§2/§4/§6/§7/§8/§12/§13/§16; build
  corrections under bl-72a8.
- **bl-cef0** migration from legacy balls — RESOLVED into **§16**. A one-shot throwaway *script*
  (not a verb — same retirement as init→prime / review→close / remaster), splitting base-field
  migration from per-plugin state migration on the §14 plugin-territory boundary, governed by
  migrate-clean-or-delink. Re-admits `priority` to core (§3/§9/§10). See §16.
- **bl-4778** states-as-config — RESOLVED by SUBTRACTION: there is **no `state`/`status` field at
  all**. Status is a DERIVED VIEW computed by a short-circuit ladder over exactly THREE live states:
  `claimant` set ⇒ **claimed** (claim-blockers not even evaluated); else unresolved claim-blocker ⇒
  **blocked**; else ⇒ **ready** (= the `ready()` predicate §10). "blocked" is claim-blockers ONLY —
  a close-blocker yields no status (a claimed ball with an open gate is just *claimed*), which is the
  same reason `review` was abolished (it was never functional). closed/dropped are absence, not
  states (file deleted + `bl-op`, §5/§9). A stored status would have zero core behavior (`ready()`
  never reads it), making it a single-valued tag — so it folds away; non-deriving human intent
  (`deferred`/`triage`) is a `tag`. The whole config cluster goes with it: no `state`
  field, **no `default_state`, no `states` vocab list, no per-op target knob** (§4), and **no
  `bl-from-state`/`bl-to-state` trailers** (§5 — `bl-op` names the transition). occupancy is the
  `claimant` field, the one structured fact the claim-guard reads (§0/§3). A team wanting a stored,
  ordered pipeline opts in OUTSIDE core via an unknown preserved `state:` key + a display plugin
  (§3) — severable, never a core field. Touched §0/§3/§4/§5/§9.

## §16 Migration from legacy balls

Legacy balls (pre-greenfield): task JSON on the `balls/tasks` orphan branch, plugin state inline in
the core JSON, a pile of config knobs, `[bl-xxxx]` tags on `main`. Greenfield: §2 markdown `tasks/`
on `balls/tasks` + config on `balls/config`, §1 XDG, §6 hook-list plugins. Migration is a **one-shot,
throwaway transform SCRIPT — not a verb.** A `bl migrate` would be the §0 "new verb is a smell" for a
job that runs once over a handful of known repos (`init`→`prime`, `review`→`close`, `repair`→verbs,
`remaster` all retired the same way). The script does ONLY the irreducible format transform;
everything ongoing — XDG bootstrap, worktree re-materialization — is already `bl prime`'s idempotent
job (§12/§13), so the script ends by handing off to `prime`.

**Governing principle — migrate-clean-or-delink, never guess.** The script transforms only what maps
deterministically and DELINKS anything it cannot prove (an unresolvable reference, a plugin's private
state); reconstruction is deferred to the authoritative source — the plugin's own adoption (below).
Single-source-of-truth applied to migration: never fabricate a mapping
the transform can't derive.

**Split on the plugin-territory boundary** (the same plugin-territory boundary as §14 scratch):
migration is NOT one script but **base-migrates-core PLUS each-plugin-migrates-its-own-territory.**
- **Base migrator** owns core fields only (§3 schema); it never reads plugin state.
- **Each plugin** owns its legacy state: its greenfield port carries a one-time *legacy-adoption*
  that seeds its §14 XDG scratch from the old inline blob.

**Core field mapping (base migrator).** Read `balls/tasks:.balls/tasks/*.json`; skip `status: closed`
(closed = file-absent, §9); write `tasks/<id>.md`:
- direct: `claimed_by`→`claimant`, `created_at`→`created`, `updated_at`→`updated`, `parent`,
  `priority`, `tags`; `description`→ the markdown body.
- `depends_on: [id]` → `blockers: [{id, on: claim}]`.
- `type: epic` → `tags += epic`; `status: deferred` → `tags += deferred` (§3 — both are tags;
  expect deferred balls to surface in `bl ready`, which is intended, not a regression).
- **epic reciprocal edge (a reconstruction, not a rename):** for each LIVE child, add
  `{child, on: claim}` to its parent's `blockers` (§10). Legacy stored only the child→parent pointer
  and derived the rest from `status`/`closed_children`. Greenfield `parent` is containment ONLY and
  implies no edge (§10), so the migrator must mint this claim-blocker explicitly to preserve legacy
  "epic waits on its children" — without it the epic migrates spuriously `ready`. (This is the one
  place the migrator re-creates an edge the old implicit model derived; it is `--blocks claim` per
  child, done in the transform.) Closed children are skipped (absent file = resolved); a live child
  whose parent did not migrate has its now-dangling `parent:` nulled.
- **dropped** (no core home): `id` (= filename, §3); `status`/`delivered_in`/`branch`/
  `closed_children` (derived, §3/§11); `repo` (the store knows it, §12); `type` (folded to tag);
  `links` (legacy-unused); `external`/`synced_at` (plugin territory — below).

**Config mapping — most knobs dissolve** (`.balls/config.json` → `config/balls.toml` on `balls/config`,
§4): `id_length` is dropped (the id scheme is fixed — a custom scheme is a `create/pre` plugin, not
config); the remote becomes the tracker's; `tasks_branch` defaults to
`balls/tasks` (§4). Gone entirely — `version`, `worktree_dir` (path derived, §11), `protected_main`
(nothing-on-main is structural, §0), `auto_fetch_on_ready` (sync-every-op default, §13),
`stale_threshold_seconds` (→ the tracker's own §1 territory, not core). The legacy
`plugins: { name: {enabled, config_file} }` map → the §6 hook list: `config/plugins.toml` `[hooks]`
entries naming each enabled plugin in the op-phases it handles (op/phase read from `<name> protocol`),
local gitignored `bin/<name>`, and each `config_file`'s content → `config/plugins/<name>/`.

**Plugin state (the per-plugin half).** Legacy plugin state lived inline in core
(`external.<plugin>.*`, `synced_at.<plugin>`). The base migrator DROPS it; the plugin's greenfield
port re-adopts. Worked example — **github-issues**: it keyed task↔issue ONLY by core
`external.github-issues.issue.number`, so a naive drop would unmatch on the next sync. Its port's
one-time adoption seeds `plugins/github-issues/<id>/` (§14 scratch) from the old number, so the next
`sync` re-adopts the existing issue with ZERO dup. Skip the adoption and the cost is bounded — ONE
dup per task on first sync (the plugin re-records and stabilizes; never runaway) — which is the
accepted floor of migrate-clean-or-delink, not a failure.

**Branch & history.** Greenfield uses TWO branches — `balls/config` (landing) + `balls/tasks` (store);
legacy used `balls/tasks` for the JSON store, so the store branch NAME collides. The script writes a
fresh orphan `balls/config` (seed config incl. `tasks_branch`) and migrates the legacy JSON into a
fresh greenfield `tasks/` on `balls/tasks`. Cutting a shared `origin/balls/tasks` over is a one-time,
human-coordinated migration: `bl install` writes the greenfield store and its per-op store sync (§12,
on by default) pushes it — no separate push step. The push may force-rewrite the shared ref; that is
intrinsic to a format change, not a thing core guards (git is the recovery net, §6 — `git branch
balls-archive origin/balls/tasks` first if you want the legacy history kept locally). The cutover
runbook is bl-0802, not a core-format concern. `main`'s legacy `[bl-xxxx]` commit-subject
tags stay untouched: forward-compatible with §11's delivery tag, so the `delivered_in` query (§11)
works over old history for free.

**Preconditions / guards.** One-shot, NOT idempotent-converge (that is `prime`'s contract): the
script REFUSES if `balls/config` already exists, and REFUSES if any live task is `claimed` (a claimed task's
in-flight code worktree would be stranded when `prime` re-materializes a fresh `work/<id>` — quiesce
first: merge/close/unclaim in-flight work before migrating). Sequence: run the script → `bl prime`
brings XDG/worktrees/config to readiness (§12) → each plugin's port runs its one-time adoption.
Any residual drift surfaces at point-of-use: the next op that needs a missing or stale piece fails
naming the verb that fixes it (`prime` re-materializes, `install` re-resolves a `bin/`, `sync`
refreshes the store, `update` unlinks a bad edge) — there is no separate scan verb.
